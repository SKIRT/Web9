In this tutorial, you will extend the \c SKIRT code with a new geometry that can be used for the spatial distribution
of  sources or media. Specifically, you will implement the isothermal disk as illustrated above.


\section TutorialDevelopGeomPre Getting ready

Before starting this tutorial, you should know how to use \c SKIRT as described in the User Guide and in the various
user tutorials. You should be ready to use a text editor or an integrated development environment to modify portions of
the \c SKIRT source code and rebuild the project as described in the Installation Guide.


\section TutorialDevelopGeomBack Background information

As a first step, please read the following two topics in the Developer Guide, which provide the background information
required to follow along with this tutorial:

- <a href="../skirt9/_dev_struct.html">Structure of the code</a>
- <a href="../skirt9/_dev_items.html">Creating simulation items</a>

In summary, a \c SKIRT simulation is represented in memory as run-time hierarchy of objects, called <em>simulation
items</em>, reflecting the structure of a \em ski file. Each simulation item is an instance of a C++ class that
inherits the SimulationItem class. Thus, simulation items form a compile-time class hierarchy through inheritance (with
the SimulationItem class at the top), and a run-time object hierarchy through pointers (with an instance of a
Simulation subclass at the top).

The \c SKIRT code includes a \em discovery mechanism that allows all information about a simulation item class to be
defined in a single place. All relevant metadata, such property definitions and human readable strings to describe
these properties, are provided in the class declaration itself rather than being scattered across the code.


\section TutorialDevelopGeomMat The mathematics

The new geometry is an isothermal disk with the axisymmetric density profile
\f[ \rho({\bf{r}}) \equiv \rho(R,z)
= \rho_0\,\exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\, {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \f]
with the scalelength \f$h_R\f$ and the scaleheight \f$h_z\f$ as two free parameters.

\subsection TutorialDevelopGeomMatDens Density

The Geometry class documentation states that all geometries in \c SKIRT must be normalized so that the total mass
is equal to one. Given this normalization, we can determine the central
density for the new geometry as a function of \f$h_R\f$ and \f$h_z\f$. We find
\f[ M = \iiint \rho({\bf{r}})\, {\text{d}}{\bf{r}}
= 2\pi\,\rho_0 \int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\,R\,{\text{d}}R
\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right)\,{\text{d}}z. \f]
Using the equalities \f[ \int_0^\infty x\,{\text{e}}^{-x}\,{\text{d}}x
= \int_0^\infty {\text{sech}}^2 x\,{\text{d}}x = 1 \f]
we find that \f[ M = 4\pi\,h_R^2\,h_z \,\rho_0\f]
and hence (using \f$M=1\f$) \f[ \rho_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi\,h_R^2\,h_z}. \f]
The density \f$\rho(R,z)\f$ is then easily calculated using its original definition above.

\subsection TutorialDevelopGeomMatSurfDens Surface densities

We also need to calculate the edge-on and face-on surface densities \f$\Sigma_R\f$ and \f$\Sigma_Z\f$.
The documentation for the AxGeometry::SigmaR() function defines the edge-on or radial surface density
as the integration of the density along a line in the equatorial plane starting at the centre of the coordinate
system, \f[ \Sigma_R = \int_0^\infty \rho(R,0)\,{\text{d}}R. \f]
The documentation for the Geometry::SigmaZ() function defines the face-on or Z-axis surface density
as the integration of the density along the entire Z-axis,
\f[ \Sigma_Z = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(0,z)\,{\text{d}}z. \f]
In our present case, we find
\f[ \Sigma_R = \rho_0\int_0^\infty \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right)\,{\text{d}}R = \rho_0\,h_R\f] and
\f[ \Sigma_Z = \rho_0\int_{-\infty}^\infty {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right)\,{\text{d}}z = 2\,\rho_0\,h_z.\f]

\subsection TutorialDevelopGeomMatRan Random position

Finally a geometry must be able to draw a random position from its three-dimensional probability density
distribution. For an axisymmetric geometry with separable density function, the problem is reduced to drawing
two values, each from a one-dimensional probability distribution, in the radial and vertical directions.

The documentation for the SepAxGeometry::randomR() function states that it returns
a random \f$R\f$ from the one-dimensional probability
distribution \f[ p(R)\, {\text{d}}R = 2\pi\, \rho_R(R)\, R\, {\text{d}}R. \f]
In the present case we find
\f[ p(R)\,{\text{d}}R = \frac{\rho(R,z)\,R\,{\text{d}}R}{\int_0^\infty \rho(R',z)\,R'\,{\text{d}}R'}
= \frac{1}{h_R^2} \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right) \,R\,{\text{d}}R \f]
with cumulative distribution
\f[ P(R) = \int_0^R p(R')\,{\text{d}}R' = 1 - \left( 1+\frac{R}{h_R}\right) \exp\left(-\frac{R}{h_R}\right). \f]
Solving \f${\cal{X}}=P(R)\f$ for \f$R\f$, where \f$\cal{X}\f$ is a uniform random deviate, we obtain
\f[ R = h_R \left[ -1-W_{-1} \left(\frac{ {\cal{X}}-1}{\text{e}}\right) \right] \f]
where \f$W_{-1}\f$ is the Lambert function of order \f$-1\f$, which can be calculated in \c SKIRT using
the function SpecialFunctions::LambertW1().

The documentation for the SepAxGeometry::randomz() function states that it returns
a random \f$z\f$ from the one-dimensional probability distribution
\f[ p(z)\, {\text{d}}z = \rho_z(z)\, {\text{d}}z. \f]
In the present case we find
\f[ p(z)\,{\text{d}}z = \frac{\rho(R,z)\,{\text{d}}z}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty \rho(R,z')\,{\text{d}}z'}
= \frac{1}{2\,h_z} {\text{sech}}^2\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \,{\text{d}}z \f]
with cumulative distribution
\f[ P(z) = \int_{-\infty}^z p(z')\,{\text{d}}z' = \frac12\left[ 1+{\text{tanh}}\left(\frac{z}{h_z}\right) \right]. \f]
Solving \f${\cal{X}}=P(z)\f$ for \f$z\f$, where \f$\cal{X}\f$ is a uniform random deviate, we obtain
\f[ z = h_z\,{\text{artanh}}(2{\cal{X}}-1) = \frac12\,h_z\,\ln\frac{{\cal{X}}}{1-{\cal{X}}}, \f]
where we used the identity
\f[ {\text{artanh}}\,x=\frac12\ln\frac{1+x}{1-x}. \f]

\section TutorialDevelopGeomSco Scoping out the work

To add a new geometry, you need to create a new class and tie it into the simulation item class hierarchy. Rather than
reinventing the wheel, browse the \c SKIRT documentation and look for an existing class with properties similar to your
needs. It so happens that the ExpDiskGeometry class also defines an axisymmetric dust disk. To examine it more closely,
open the \c ExpDiskGeometry.hpp header file in the code editor.

It turns out that ExpDiskGeometry inherits from SepAxGeometry, an abstract class representing axisymmetric dust
geometries where the density is a separable function of \f$R\f$ and \f$z\f$. The \c PROPERTY and \c ATTRIBUTE macros
define properties for the scale length \f$h_R\f$ and the scale height \f$h_z\f$, corresponding to the free parameters
you need, plus several properties related to inner and outer truncation of the disk, which you don't need but can
easily be removed. These macros actually provide the metadata used by the discovery mechanism, in addition to defining
appropriate public getter functions with the same name as the corresponding property.

Furthermore, ExpDiskGeometry offers the following functions:
 - the setupSelfBefore() function, which calculates the central density \f$\rho_0\f$ and stores the result in a
   data member for later use;
 - the functions density(), randomCylRadius(), randomZ(), SigmaR(), and SigmaZ(), which implement various aspects of
   the geometry modeled by this class.

You can use the same structure for your new class. The main work will consist of adjusting the key functions for the
new geometry.

\section TutorialDevelopGeomCre Creating the new source and header files

Locate the files \c ExpDiskGeometry.hpp and \c ExpDiskGeometry.cpp in your local working copy of the \c SKIRT source
code (in the <tt>SKIRT/core</tt> directory), and copy them to a set of new files named \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp
and \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.cpp (in the same directory). Do not remove the original files!

In the new header file (.hpp), replace the two occurrences of \c "EXPDISKGEOMETRY_HPP" by \c "ISOTHERMALDISKGEOMETRY_HPP".
This is the standard header guard to avoid multiple includes of the same class definition.

In both new files (.hpp and .cpp), replace all occurrences of \c "ExpDiskGeometry" by \c "IsoThermalDiskGeometry".

Build the \c SKIRT project with these changes. Depending on the build procedure in use, you may need to explicitly
rerun CMake for the build system to recognize the newly introduced source files. To make sure that the new files are
actually being compiled, introduce a syntax error and verify that the compiler catches it. After correcting these
intentionally introduced issues, there should be no compilation or build errors left at this point.

\section TutorialDevelopGeomDec The class declaration

Because the class declaration for IsoThermalDiskGeometry is very similar to that of ExpDiskGeometry, the header file \c
IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp for your new class does not need a lot of work.

Adjust the description of the class in the \c ITEM_CONCRETE macro. For example, replace "an exponential disk geometry"
by "an iso-thermal disk geometry". This text will be used for identifying your new geometry to a user, such as when
constructing a new .ski file during an interactive Q&A session.

Remove the \c PROPERTY and \c ATTRIBUTE macros for the truncation parameters, and the corresponding data members, since
these parameters are not needed in the new class.

While updating the documentation, take care to follow the rules for comments in "/ **"-style documentation blocks.
These comments are processed by the <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> utility to produce the \c SKIRT manual
in HTML format. It is \em really important to write decent comments for every function. When in doubt about the syntax
for formatting comments, look for examples elsewhere in the \c SKIRT source code or check the <a
href="http://www.doxygen.org/manual.html">Doxygen manual</a> on the web.

\section TutorialDevelopGeomDef The class definition

The source file \c IsoThermalDiskGeometry.cpp needs more extensive edits beyond replacing the class name.

The implementation of the function setupSelfBefore() must always start with a call to the same function in the base
class (SepAxGeometry in this case). This call should remain unchanged. Remove the code that verifies the values of the
truncation-related properties, and update the code that calculates the central density:

\verbatim
void IsoThermalDiskGeometry::setupSelfBefore()
{
    SepAxGeometry::setupSelfBefore();

    // calculate central density
    _rho0 = 1.0/(4.0*M_PI*_hz*_hR*_hR);
}
\endverbatim

Update the implementation of the functions density(), sigmaR(), and sigmaZ() to reflect the (surface) density formulas
derived before:

\verbatim
double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::density(double R, double z) const
{
    double sechz = 1.0 / cosh(z/_hz);
    return _rho0 * exp(-R/_hR) * sechz*sechz;
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::sigmaR() const
{
    return _rho0*_hR;
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::sigmaZ() const
{
    return 2.0*_rho0*_hz;
}
\endverbatim

Update the implementation of the functions randomCylRadius() and randomZ() to reflect the formulas derived before
for generating the appropriate random values:

\verbatim
double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::randomCylRadius() const
{
    double X = random()->uniform();
    return _hR * (-1.0-SpecialFunctions::LambertW1((X-1.0)/M_E));
}

double IsoThermalDiskGeometry::randomZ() const
{
    double X = random()->uniform();
    return 0.5 * _hz * log(X/(1.0-X));
}
\endverbatim

Save your changes and perform a build. There should be no errors.

\section TutorialDevelopGeomReg Registering the new class

Having declared and defined the new class, you must make its existence known to the \c SKIRT discovery mechanism so
that it will be properly listed when constructing a new .ski file during an interactive Q&A session. Note that this
registration requirement applies only to simulation item classes, i.e. classes that inherit directly or indirectly from
the SimulationItem class, as is the case for your new IsoThermalDiskGeometry class.

Locate and open the file \c SimulationItemRegistry.cpp (also in the <tt>SKIRT/core</tt> directory). You need to add two
lines in this file: an \c include directive for the new class header, and an \c add<> statement to register the new
class.

Add the \c include directive to the already long list of \c include directives, in alpahabetical order. For
example:

\verbatim
#include "IsoThermalDiskGeometry.hpp"
#include "IsotropicAngularDistribution.hpp"
...
\endverbatim

Insert a new \c add<> statement to the existing list, in the location you want it to appear in the corresponding choice
list while creating a new .ski file in the interactive Q&A session. In this case, locate the list of \c add<>
statements for geometry classes and insert a new statement (for example) right after the one for the ExpDiskGeometry
class:

\verbatim
    ItemRegistry::add<ExpDiskGeometry>();
    ItemRegistry::add<IsoThermalDiskGeometry>();
    ...
\endverbatim

Again save your changes and perform a build. Assuming there are no errors, \c SKIRT is now ready for use with the new
geometry.

\section TutorialDevelopGeomUse Using the new class

Launch the newly built \c SKIRT version without any command line arguments. Provide appropriate responses to the
interactive questions for a simulation with a source or medium component using a built-in geometry. The list of choices
will include a new item for the iso-thermal disk geometry:

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the geometry of the spatial luminosity distribution for the source:
      1. A Plummer geometry
      2. A gamma geometry
         ...
      7. An exponential disk geometry
      8. An iso-thermal disk geometry
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,21] (1): 8
\endverbatim

Enter the appropriate choice to select your new geometry and complete the Q&A session to save the ski file.
Alternatively, you can edit a copy of a ski file you made earlier to use your new geometry.

To verify the results for a primary source distribution, run a simulation without media and with appropriate frame
instruments to generate an image of the surface brightness observed from a few relevant viewing angles.

To verify the results for a medium density distribution, include the \c DefaultMediaDensityCutsProbe probe to generate
cuts through the medium along the coordinate axes.
