\page TutorialCustomDust Configuring custom dust mixes

This advanced tutorial explores the mechanisms for configuring custom dust mixes in SKIRT. The built-in turn-key dust
mixes are sufficient for many applications and should remain the preferred choice for beginning (and many advanced)
users. On the other hand, the flexibility to specify a customized dust model enables many powerful applications,
including:

 - Investigating the effect of changing optical material properties, relative abundances, grain size distributions,
 and so forth on the observed extinction and emission characteristics of a given model or class of models.
 See section \ref TutorialCustomDustProps below.

 - Spatially varying the properties of the dust in models imported from hydrodynamical snapshots by assigning a
 different type of dust (material type, grain size, etc.) to each particle or cell.
 See section \ref TutorialCustomDustImport below.

\section TutorialCustomDustPre Getting ready

Because this is an advanced tutorial, it assumes that you:

 - have installed SKIRT and any relevant visualization tools
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_installation_guide.html">The SKIRT installation guide</a>);
 - know how to operate SKIRT by completing the introductory SKIRT tutorials (see \ref Tutorials);
 - understand the structure of ski files and know how to manually update them
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_user_param_file.html">The SKIRT parameter file format</a>);
 - have a working knowledge of interstellar dust concepts, including material types, absorption and scattering
   processes, grain size distributions, wavelength dependence and so forth;
 - have a basic understanding of how dust mixes are implemented in SKIRT
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_dust_properties.html">Dust properties in SKIRT</a>).

After all of that, you are ready to take a deep dive into the world of custom SKIRT dust mixes...


\section TutorialCustomDustProps Customizing dust properties

## Reference model

In the first part of the tutorial we study a basic, spherically symmetric SKIRT model with a central point source
surrounded by a shell of dust. The reference model described in this section uses the built-in Zubko et al. 2004 dust
mix, which is replaced in later sections by custom dust mix variations.

The complete ski file for the reference model is listed below. You can copy and paste it into a text file, run it
with SKIRT, and manually adjust the dust mix configuration while working through the following sections.

The central point source is assigned the typical spectrum of a fairly young stellar population. The surrounding dust is
distributed as a shell with a radius of 1 pc and a shallow exponential radial density profile. The total dust mass is
set to 1 solar mass, resulting is a radial V-band optical depth of approximately 2.12, as can be seen in the text file
produced by the \c SpatialGridConvergenceProbe. The following figures show a cut through the dust density and a cut
through the indicative dust temperature, respectively generated by the \c DefaultMediaDensityCutsProbe and the \c
DefaultDustTemperatureCutsProbe.

| Dust density | Indicative dust temperature |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| ![ ](TutorialCustomDustPropsDensityCut.png) | ![ ](TutorialCustomDustPropsTemperatureCut.png) |

To capture as many aspects of the influence of dust properties as possible, we configure a panchromatic simulation from
UV to submillimeter wavelengths taking into account stochastic heating of small grains. The built-in Zubko dust mix is
configured with a suffiently large number of size bins to properly resolve the grain size distributions when
calculating the emission spectrum for each material type and for each representative grain size.

The following figure shows the SED produced by this reference configuration, separated into its stellar and
dust emission components. The dashed line indicates the stellar spectrum without dust extinction.

The \c OpticalMaterialPropertiesProbe ("1") outputs the aggregate optical properties of the dust mix as a function of
wavelength. For convenience depending on the user's needs, the extinction properties are listed in two equivalent
forms: as a cross section per hydrogen atom (in \f$\mathrm{m}^2\f$) and as a mass coefficient (in \f$\mathrm{m}^2
\;\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\f$). These two quantities are connected through the dust mass per hydrogen atom for the dust mix,
which is listed (in \f$\mathrm{kg}\f$) on the very first line of the file.

The \c DustGrainPopulationsProbe ("2") outputs some characteristics for each of the grain populations in the dust mix.
A grain population defines a grain material type and a corresponding grain size distribution. The built-in Zubko dust
mix includes four grain populations:

\verbatim
# ... dust mass per hydrogen atom: 1.305623577e-29 kg
...
0 Draine_Silicate     62.1543 8.115005680e-30 4.851668068e-03 ...
1 Draine_Graphite     32.8185 4.284855429e-30 2.561759915e-03 ...
2 Draine_Neutral_PAH   2.5136 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
3 Draine_Ionized_PAH   2.5136 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
\endverbatim

The first column after the material type name lists the relative mass of each population in the total mix, as a
percentage. The next two columns list the absolute mass in two forms: per hydrogen atom and per hydrogen mass.
These numbers are provided for convenience when comparing a configured dust mix to dust models in the literature.

The \c DustGrainSizeDistributionProbe ("3") outputs the size distribution for each of the grain populations (in
separate files). A grain size distribution is \em not a normalized probability distribution; the scaling of the
values is taken into account when integrating over the size distribution to calculate aggregate
or representative properties.

Many of these concepts will play an important role later in this tutorial.

## Duplicating a built-in dust mix

Although the turn-key dust mixes built into SKIRT are hardwired in the code, they effectively use the same components
as those used to configure a custom dust mix. For example, the built-in Zubko dust mix is coded as follows (see the
ZubkoDustMix class):

\verbatim
addPopulation(new DraineSilicateGrainComposition(this), new ZubkoSilicateGrainSizeDistribution(this),
              _numSilicateSizes, GrainPopulation::NormalizationType::FactorOnSizeDistribution, 1.);
addPopulation(new DraineGraphiteGrainComposition(this), new ZubkoGraphiteGrainSizeDistribution(this),
              _numGraphiteSizes, GrainPopulation::NormalizationType::FactorOnSizeDistribution, 1.);
addPopulation(new DraineNeutralPAHGrainComposition(this), new ZubkoPAHGrainSizeDistribution(this),
              _numPAHSizes, GrainPopulation::NormalizationType::FactorOnSizeDistribution, 0.5);
addPopulation(new DraineIonizedPAHGrainComposition(this), new ZubkoPAHGrainSizeDistribution(this),
              _numPAHSizes, GrainPopulation::NormalizationType::FactorOnSizeDistribution, 0.5);
\endverbatim

Assuming that the number of size bins for each population is configured as for the reference model above, this
translates to the following equivalent ski file configuration:

\verbatim
<ConfigurableDustMix scatteringType="HenyeyGreenstein">
    <populations type="GrainPopulation">
        <GrainPopulation numSizes="15" normalizationType="FactorOnSizeDistribution" factorOnSizeDistribution="1">

        </GrainPopulation>
        <GrainPopulation numSizes="10" normalizationType="FactorOnSizeDistribution" factorOnSizeDistribution="0.5">

            </composition>
            <sizeDistribution type="GrainSizeDistribution">
                <ZubkoPAHGrainSizeDistribution/>
            </sizeDistribution>
        </GrainPopulation>
        <GrainPopulation numSizes="10" normalizationType="FactorOnSizeDistribution" factorOnSizeDistribution="0.5">
            <composition type="GrainComposition">

            </composition>
            <sizeDistribution type="GrainSizeDistribution">
                <ZubkoPAHGrainSizeDistribution/>
            </sizeDistribution>
        </GrainPopulation>
    </populations>
</ConfigurableDustMix>
\endverbatim

The \c scatteringType property of a configurable dust mix specifies the type of scattering phase function suppported by
and used for all grain populations in the dust mix. The Henyey-Greenstein phase function is the most commonly used
phase function in SKIRT. It assumes spherical dust grains and requires each dust population to specify the scattering
asymmetry parameter \f$g=\left<\cos\theta\right>\f$, i.e. the average cosine of the scattering angle \f$\theta\f$, as a
function of wavelength. For now, we will limit the discussion to dust populations that use the Henyey-Greenstein phase
function.

A configurable dust mix contains one or more dust grain populations. The order in which they appear is irrelevant for
the physics but is reflected in the output produced by some probes, such as the probes "2" and "3" discussed before.
Each grain population is defined by specifying the following items:

- The grain composition defines the optical and calorimetric properties of a population of dust grains with a given
material composition. The basic optical properties include the dimensionless absorption and scattering efficiencies
\f$Q^\text{abs}(a,\lambda)\f$ and \f$Q^\text{sca}(a,\lambda)\f$ in addition to the scattering asymmetry parameter
\f$g(a,\lambda)\f$ as a function of the grain size (radius) \f$a\f$ and the wavelength \f$\lambda\f$ of the incoming
photon. The calorimetric properties consist of the material's specific enthalpy or, equivalently, the specific heat
capacity as a function of temperature. A final property is the bulk mass density \f$\rho_\text{bulk}\f$ of the
grain material. All of these data are loaded from tables provided as built-in resources for various material types.

- The grain size distribution defines the abundances of various grain sizes in the dust population. Specifically, it
 represents a function \f$\Omega(a)\f$ that specifies the number of dust grains with size \f$a\f$ in the population per
 hydrogen atom, \f$ \Omega(a) \propto \frac{\text{d}n_\text{D}}{\text{d}a}/n_\text{H} \f$ for \f$ a_\text{min} \leq a
 \leq a_\text{max} \f$. SKIRT offers various built-in grain size distributions and allows loading a size distribution
 from a user-provided column text file.

- The size distribution "normalization" determines the proportionality factor to be used in the definition of
 \f$\Omega(a)\f$ above. The term "normalization" is somewhat confusing because, as mentioned before, a grain size
 distribution is \em not a normalized probability distribution. Instead, the "normalization" actually scales the number
 of grains present in the population. SKIRT offers several "normalization" mechanisms which may come in handy depending
 on the selected type of size distribution and/or the information provided in the literature concerning a particular
 size distribution.

- The number of grain sizes determines the level of accuracy for the discretization of the grain size distribution.
 This is not relevant for the optical properties of the population, which are obtained by integrating over the full
 size distribution. However, the emission spectrum (and, if in equilibrium, the temperature) of a dust grain embedded
 in a given radiation field depends on the grain size. It is thus necessary to calculate this spectrum for a
 representative grain in each of a number of size bins. The bins are distributed logarithmically
 over the range of the size distribution.

For a given grain population, the dust mass per hydrogen atom \f$\mu\f$ is calculated by integrating the bulk density
over the size distribution, \f[ \mu = \int_{a_{\text{min}}}^{a_{\text{max}}} \Omega_c(a)\, \rho_{\text{bulk},c}\,
\frac{4\pi}{3}\, a^3\, {\text{d}}a. \f] Similarly, the total extinction cross section per hydrogen atom
\f$\varsigma^{\text{ext}} (\lambda)\f$ as a function of wavelength \f$\lambda\f$ is obtained using \f[
\varsigma^{\text{ext}}(\lambda) = \int_{a_{\text{min}}}^{a_{\text{max}}} \Omega(a)\, (Q^\text{abs}(a,\lambda) +
Q^\text{sca}(a,\lambda))\, \pi a^2\, {\text{d}}a. \f] From these formulas, it is clear that both the dust mass and the
cross section per hydrogen atom scale with the proportionality factor of the size distribution.

## Separating the dust grain populations

After replacing the \c ZubkoDustMix in the reference configuration by the \c ConfigurableDustMix listed in the previous
section, SKIRT obviously produces the same results (apart from Monte Carlo noise). However, now we can adjust the
configuration at will. For example, we can run the simulation with just the silicates (remove all but the first grain
population), just the graphites (remove all but the second grain population), and just the PAHs (remove all but the
third and last grain populations).

Comparing the relevant lines from the probe "2" output for the three simulations with the output for the complete Zubko
dust mix shown before, we find that the absolute mass per hydrogen for each population has remained unchanged (the
precentages indicating the relative contributions of course did change):

\verbatim
# Silicates
0 Draine_Silicate 100.0000 8.115005680e-30 4.851668068e-03 ...

# Graphites
0 Draine_Graphite 100.0000 4.284855429e-30 2.561759915e-03 ...

# PAHs
0 Draine_Neutral_PAH  50.0000 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
1 Draine_Ionized_PAH  50.0000 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
\endverbatim

The aggregate optical properties listed in the probe "1" output have adjusted as well. Let us investigate the values
corresponding to a wavelength of 0.09 micron (the first data row in each file). As expected, the extinction cross
sections and the masses per hydrogen atom for the three seperate grain populations add up to the corresponding
quantities of the original dust mix. In other words, \f[ \varsigma=\sum_c\varsigma_{c} \quad;\quad \mu=\sum_c\mu_{c},
\f] where the sum runs over the individual grain populations. On the other hand, the extinction mass coefficients for
the seperated grain populations do \em not add up to the extinction mass coefficient of the combined dust mix. In fact,
the difference is quite substantial. The reason for this becomes obvious from the definition of mass coefficient, \f[
\kappa=\frac{\varsigma}{\mu}=\frac{\sum_c\varsigma_{c}}{\sum_c\mu_{c}} \neq
\sum_c\frac{\varsigma_{c}}{\mu_c}=\sum_c\kappa_{c}. \f]

The output of the convergence probe lists the V-band optical depth across a diameter of the shell:

| Simulation | V-band optical depth |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Combined   |    4.24707    |
| Silicates  |    2.10456    |
| Graphites  |    8.54227    |
| PAHs       |    2.69634    |

It may be surprising that the optical depths for the separate populations don't add up to the optical depth of the
combined dust mix. The reason for this again becomes clear from the relevant definitions. Because the volume, radial
structure and total mass of the dust are fixed by the shell geometry and its normalization, the radial dust density
distribution \f$\rho(r)\f$ is identical for the four simulations. Furthermore, the optical properties of the dust are
spatially constant (but different in each of the simulations). We can thus write the radial optical depth as \f$\tau =
\kappa \int_0^\infty \rho(r) \,\text{d}r\f$, where the integral has the same value for the four simulations. In other
words, the optical depth is proportional to the extinction mass coefficient, and we already know that mass coefficients
do not add up. It can be easily verified that the optical depths listed in the table above indeed scale proportionally
with the extinction mass coefficients at a wavelength of 0.55 \f$\mu\text{m}\f$, which can be found in the output of
probes "1".

In the above we used the \c MassMaterialNormalization to fix the total dust mass of the geometry. In simple models
like this, one often instead uses the \c OpticalDepthMaterialNormalization to fix the optical depth along one of the
coordinate axes at a given wavelength. In this case, by a similar reasoning, the resulting total dust mass will scale
inversely proportional to the extinction mass coefficient of the dust mix at the relevant wavelength.

## Normalizing the grain size distribution

It is clear from the previous sections that, when configuring a dust mix, it is important to get several things right
at the same time: the cross sections per hydrogen atom for each grain population, the total dust mass per hydrogen atom,
and the relative mass fractions of the grain populations. The proportionality factor or "normalization" of the
grain size distribution plays an important role in accomplishing this task.

SKIRT offers several built-in grain size distributions. The \c ZubkoXxxGrainSizeDistribution instances used in our
models so far each implement a very specific function (documented in Zubko et al. 2004) and already include the
appropriate proportionality factor. That is why our ski file uses a factor of 1 for the silicates and graphites, and a
factor of 0.5 for each of the two PAH populations (because the size distribution is scaled for the combined PAH
population).

The more generic size distributions such as <tt>(Modified)PowerLawGrainSizeDistribution</tt> and
<tt>(Modified)LogNormalGrainSizeDistribution</tt> expect the user to configure a proportionality factor. For example,
the \c PowerLawGrainSizeDistribution implements the function \f$\Omega(a) = C\, a^{-\gamma}\f$ for \f$a_\text{min} \leq
a \leq a_\text{max}\f$, where the exponent \f$\gamma>0\f$ and the size range can be configured as attributes of the
class. The factor \f$C\f$ has units of \f$\text{m}^{\gamma-1}\f$ and must be provided externally through one of the
"normalization" mechanisms. Lastly, the \c FileGrainSizeDistribution reads a user-provided column text file. In this
case, the size distribution can be scaled by scaling the values in the file or by an extra "normalization" in the ski
file, or both, at the user's discretion.

As a first test, let us increase the proportionality factor for the silicates in the Zubko configuration from 1 to 2,
leaving the other populations in place without change, and run the simulation again. The output of probe "2"
now looks like this:

\verbatim
# ... dust mass per hydrogen atom: 2.117124145e-29 kg
...
0 Draine_Silicate     76.6607 1.623001136e-29 9.703336136e-03 ...
1 Draine_Graphite     20.2390 4.284855429e-30 2.561759915e-03 ...
2 Draine_Neutral_PAH   1.5502 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
3 Draine_Ionized_PAH   1.5502 3.281873294e-31 1.962113212e-04 ...
\endverbatim

Compared to the reference configuration listed in the first section above, the dust mass per hydrogen atom for the
silicate population has doubled, the total dust mass per hydrogen atom has increased accordingly, and the share of the
silicates in the total has been adjusted. As can be easily verified from the probe "1" output of our previous
simulations, the aggregate cross sections have increased by exactly the amount corresponding to the silicate grain
population. All of this is as expected. The effect on the mass coefficients is more difficult to predict (except by
actually doing the calculations), also as expected.

To illustrate the grain size distribution "normalization" mechanisms in SKIRT, it is convenient to focus on a single
grain population. We return to a configuration with just the silicate population and a proportionality factor of 1 on
the Zubko size distribution for silicates:

\verbatim
0 Draine_Silicate 100.0000 8.115005680e-30 4.851668068e-03 3.500000000e-04 3.700000000e-01
\endverbatim

As a reminder, the columns after the percentage (100 because there is only a single population) indicate the
dust mass per hydrogen atom (in kg), the dust mass per hydrogen mass (dimensionless), and the minimum and
maximum grain size (in \f$\mu\text{m}\f$).

Our intention is to replace the Zubko size distribution by another distribution with a simpler form, while retaining
the same dust mass per hydrogen atom. We use a powerlaw size distribution with an exponent of 3.5 over the same size
range as the Zubko distribution. The complete configuration now is:

\verbatim
<ConfigurableDustMix scatteringType="HenyeyGreenstein">
    <populations type="GrainPopulation">
        <GrainPopulation numSizes="15" normalizationType="FactorOnSizeDistribution" factorOnSizeDistribution="1">
            <composition type="GrainComposition">
                <DraineSilicateGrainComposition/>
            </composition>
            <sizeDistribution type="GrainSizeDistribution">
                <PowerLawGrainSizeDistribution minSize="3.5 Angstrom" maxSize="0.37 micron" exponent="3.5"/>
            </sizeDistribution>
        </GrainPopulation>
    </populations>
</ConfigurableDustMix>
\endverbatim

This results in the following dust population characteristics:

\verbatim
0 Draine_Silicate 100.0000 1.481762434e+01 8.858921075e+27 3.500000000e-04 3.700000000e-01
\endverbatim

The dust mass per hydrogen atom is off by more than 30 orders of magnitude. It takes just a simple division to
calculate the proportionality factor needed to correct this (8.115005680e-30 / 1.481762434e+01). Because of rounding
errors it might take a couple iterations to get all the displayed digits right. The factor 5.4765902385e-31 does the
trick. After replacing the factor of 1 in the configuration by this number, the dust population characteristics of
probe "2" are identical to those of the original Zubko silicates. However, the cross sections calculated from the two
grain size distributions differ slightly, resulting in subtle differences in the observed spectrum.

The figure on the left below shows the two grain size distributions (in volume units) plotted from the files produced
by the probes "3". These probes register the bare size distributions without the front factor, so we added this factor
in the plotting routine. The figure on the right shows the corresponding observed spectra.

| Grain size distribution in volume units | Corresponding observed spectrum |
| ----- | ---- |
| ![ ](TutorialCustomDustPropsSizeDistrib.png) | ![ ](TutorialCustomDustPropsSedSizeDistrib.png) |

While experimenting with the form and range of a size distribution, it is often desirable to keep the dust mass per
hydrogen atom of the population constant so that the relative contribution of the population in the complete dust mix
remains fixed. To achieve this, the proportionality factor must be recalculated after each change to the size
distribution. To avoid this annoyance, SKIRT offers an alternative "normalization" mechanism that allows directly
specifying the dust mass per hydrogen atom or per hydrogen mass of a population. Thus, for our silicate model, the
following three lines in the ski file result in exactly the same grain population:

\verbatim
<GrainPopulation numSizes="15" normalizationType="FactorOnSizeDistribution" factorOnSizeDistribution="5.4765902385e-31">
    ... or ...
<GrainPopulation numSizes="15" normalizationType="DustMassPerHydrogenAtom" dustMassPerHydrogenAtom="8.115005680e-30 kg">
    ... or ...
<GrainPopulation numSizes="15" normalizationType="DustMassPerHydrogenMass" dustMassPerHydrogenMass="4.851668068e-03">
\endverbatim

These alternatives are especially handy when the characteristics for a grain population are specified in these terms in
the literature.

## Working with grain compositions

SKIRT offers various built-in grain compositions (i.e. grain material types), including:
 - the classic Draine et al. (amorphous) silicates, graphites and PAHs we have been using so far in this tutorial,
 - crystalline Enstatite and Forsterite silicates prepared by Michiel Min et al.,
 - a suite of material types taken from the data supplied with the DustEM code (Compiègne et al.), including more
   recent versions of Draine et al. silicates, graphites and PAHs; carbonaceous grains defined by Jones et al.; and
   amorphous olivine and pyroxene silicates defined by Koehler et al.

More information can be found in the respective class descriptions.

As an example, let us consider the THEMIS dust model. This model is already available as a turn-key dust mix in SKIRT,
however it is informative to configure it as a custom dust mix in the ski file. The following is an extract from the
input file specifying this dust model for the DustEM code:

\verbatim
# grain type, nsize, type keywords, Mdust/MH, rho, amin, amax, alpha/a0 [, at, ac, gamma (ED)] [, au, zeta, eta (CV)]

\endverbatim

The four grain populations use olivine, pyroxene, and carbonaceous grains (twice) with log-normal or modified power-law
size distributions. These size distributions are "normalized" by specifying the dust mass per hydrogen mass
(<tt>Mdust/MH</tt>). The bulk mass density is explicitly given for each material type (\c rho). The remaining columns
provide parameters for the range and form of the size distributions.

Here is the corresponding dust mix configuration in SKIRT. The concepts and values translate quite easily, although,
admittedly, the ski file version is a lot more verbose:

## Using polarization and material phase functions

Depending on the data supplied with the included dust grain compositions, a \c ConfigurableDustMix may support one or
more of the following spherical-grain scattering mechanisms (specified with the \c scatteringType attribute):

- \c HenyeyGreenstein: the Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function is widely used for dust scattering in an
 astrophysical context because it requires only a single (wavelength-dependent) parameter, namely
 \f$g=\left<\cos\theta\right>\f$, the average cosine of the scattering angle \f$\theta\f$. The resulting analytical
 phase function form is, however, not always an excellent approximation of the actual phase function.

- \c SphericalPolarization: with scattering for polarized radiation, the phase function depends on the polarization
 state of the incoming radiation, and the polarization state of the outgoing radiation is updated appropriately. The
 phase function is computed from the (wavelength and grain size-dependent) coefficients of the Mueller matrix supplied
 for the grain composition.

- \c MaterialPhaseFunction: this mode calculates the actual material phase function from (part of) the
 Mueller matrix components supplied for the grain composition, without handling polarized radiation.

All grain compositions mentioned so far in this tutorial work with the Henyey-Greenstein scattering mode and don't
support the other modes. Apart from some special-purpose dust mixes intended for use with benchmarks, only the \c
PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition and \c PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition provide the Mueller matrix data necessary to
support the \c SphericalPolarization or \c MaterialPhaseFunction modes.

## Configuring multiple medium components

In the configurations studied above, all grain populations under consideration are included in a single dust mix, which
in turn is attached to a geometry that defines the spatial dust density distribution. This implies that the dust
properties are the same everywhere in the model. We can overcome this limitation by configuring multiple media
components, each with their own geometry and dust mix. For example, assume that the original dust mix has a silicate
and a graphite grain population. We can then include the silicate population in the dust mix of the first medium
component and the graphite population in the dust mix of the second medium component. Remember that we also need to
adjust the normalization of the dust mass for each medium component to reflect the relative contribution of silicates
and graphites. We can then control the spatial distribution for silicates and graphites separately by configuring
different geometries for each medium component.

While this approach works perfectly for simple geometric or even imported models, it becomes unwieldy when the density
distributions for a nontrivial number of separate grain populations are being imported from hydrodynamical snapshot
data. This use case is discussed in the second part of this tutorial.


\section TutorialCustomDustImport Spatially varying the dust mix in imported models

## Reference model

In the second part of the tutorial we use SKIRT models that read both the source and medium setup from smoothed
particle data provided as column text files. Rather than supplying data derived from an actual hydrodynamical
simulation snapshot, we manually construct simple input data files that illustrate the concepts under study.

We first construct a reference model that we can use as the basis for further exploration. The model includes three
identical sources lined up on the x-axis. Each source is embedded in a blob of dust that may have different properties.
In the reference model we use a single dust mix; the only difference between the blobs is their mass. By smartly
positioning a frame instrument so that each pixel covers a single source/blob combination, we can we evaluate the
extinction characteristics for each dust blob separately.

The following column text data file defines the three sources for our model; this file will remain unchanged for all
models considered in this tutorial:

\verbatim
# sources.txt
# Column 1: position x (pc)
# Column 2: position y (pc)
# Column 3: position z (pc)
# Column 4: smoothing length (pc)
# Column 5: blackbody radius (km)
# Column 6: blackbody temperature (K)
-0.66666 0  0  0.001  1e3   12000
 0       0  0  0.001  1e3   12000
 0.66666 0  0  0.001  1e3   12000
\endverbatim

The column information in the header is optional but highly recommended. Apart from explicitly declaring the units for
the tabulated quantities, the column names are reproduced in the SKIRT log file, providing an additional sanity check
on the imported data. The luminosity and spectrum of the sources are specified through the radius and temperature of a
blackbody emitter.

The following column text data file defines the three dust blobs enveloping the sources in our model; the contents of
this file will vary along with the ski file during our further exploration:

\verbatim
# dust1.txt
# Column 1: position x (pc)
# Column 2: position y (pc)
# Column 3: position z (pc)
# Column 4: smoothing length (pc)
# Column 5: dust mass (Msun)
-0.66666 0  0  0.3  0.01
 0       0  0  0.3  0.02
 0.66666 0  0  0.3  0.03
\endverbatim

The ski file configures source and media components by importing these data files:

A cut through the gridded dust density along the xy plane shows the dust blobs listed in the imported file from left to
right:

| Cut through the density distribution of the reference model |
| ------------ |
| ![ ](TutorialCustomDustImportDensityCutRef.png) |

The configured frame instrument looks down on the xy plane and has three pixels, each covering one of the source/dust
combinations. The instrument records separate flux components, including the transparent flux (i.e. as if there
were no dust) and the direct flux (i.e. the extincted flux ignoring scattering into the sight line). This means we can
plot the effect of the dust extinction for each of the blobs separately:

| Spectra for each source/dust combination in the reference model |
| ------------ |
| ![ ](TutorialCustomDustImportSpectra1.png) |

Clearly this is a contrived setup, but it allows us to explore SKIRT's capabilities for spatially varying the dust mix
in a simulation.

## Multiple particle types

In the reference model, the imported particles are all of the same type and specify a single dust mass. Now consider a
situation where there are multiple particle types corresponding to a different dust mix. For example, some
particles represent silicate dust, and other particles represent graphite dust. Each particle still carries a single
dust mass. This would lead to an import data file of the following form, with a zero-based index indicating the
particle type:

\verbatim
# dust2.txt
# Column 1: position x (pc)
# Column 2: position y (pc)
# Column 3: position z (pc)
# Column 4: smoothing length (pc)
# Column 5: dust mass (Msun)
# Column 6: dust mix index (1)
-0.66666 0  0  0.3  0.02   1
 0       0  0  0.3  0.02   0
 0.66666 0  0  0.3  0.03   1
\endverbatim

We address this situation in the ski file through the \c SelectDustMixFamily class, which uses the extra index to
select one of the dust mixes listed in its \c dustMixes property. Other than replacing \c ZubkoDustMix by \c
SelectDustMixFamily, we need to enable import of the extra column by setting the \c importVariableMixParams attribute
of the \c ParticleMedium to true. Using the silicate and graphite components of the Zubko dust mix discussed in the
first part of this tutorial, this leads to:

The adjusted ski file produces the following spectra. The middle dust blob contains only silicate so it does not show
the graphite absorption feature. The other two blobs contain only graphite and thus they show the graphite absorption
feature, at two different column densities:

## Multiple dust masses, one per type of dust

A related but different situation arises when each of the imported particles carries multiple dust masses, one for each
type of dust in the simulation. Consider an example with three dust types; silicates, graphite, and neutral PAHs:

\verbatim
# dust3.txt
# Column 1: position x (pc)
# Column 2: position y (pc)
# Column 3: position z (pc)
# Column 4: smoothing length (pc)
# Column 5: silicate mass (Msun)
# Column 6: graphite mass (Msun)
# Column 7: PAH mass (Msun)

 0       0  0  0.3   0.001  0.010  0.000
 0.66666 0  0  0.3   0.001  0.000  0.010
\endverbatim

This situation can be addressed by configuring a separate medium component for each type of dust. Each medium component
imports the same particles from the same file but picks the mass column that corresponds to the dust mix assigned to
the component. This can be achieved through the \c useColumns attribute of the \c ParticleMedium class. The definition
of the medium components now becomes:

The ski file now produces the following spectra. The extinction curves have a distinct shape (other than just a
scaling), indicating that the three blobs contain a different mixture of grain types.
