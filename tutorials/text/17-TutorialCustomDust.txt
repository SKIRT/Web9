\page TutorialCustomDust Configuring custom dust mixes

This advanced tutorial explores the mechanisms for configuring custom dust mixes in SKIRT. The built-in turn-key dust
mixes are sufficient for many applications and should remain the preferred choice for beginning (and many advanced)
users. On the other hand, the flexibility to specify a customized dust model enables many powerful applications,
including:

 - Investigating the effect of changing optical material properties, relative abundances, grain size distributions,
 and so forth on the observed extinction and emission characteristics of a given model or class of models.

 - Spatially varying the properties of the dust in models imported from hydrodynamical snapshots by assigning a
 different type of dust (material type, grain size, etc.) to each particle or cell.


\section TutorialCustomDustPre Getting ready

Because this is an advanced tutorial, it assumes that you:

 - have installed SKIRT and any relevant visualization tools
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_installation_guide.html">The SKIRT installation guide</a>);
 - know how to operate SKIRT by completing the introductory SKIRT tutorials (see \ref Tutorials);
 - understand the structure of ski files and know how to manually update them
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_user_param_file.html">The SKIRT parameter file format</a>);
 - have a working knowledge of interstellar dust concepts, including material types, absorption and scattering
   processes, grain size distributions, wavelength dependence and so forth;
 - have a basic understanding of how dust mixes are implemented in SKIRT
   (see <a href="../skirt9/_dust_properties.html">Dust properties in SKIRT</a>).

After all of that, you are ready to take a deep dive into the world of custom SKIRT dust mixes...
