\page Version9 The SKIRT project -- version 9

\section Version9Intro Introduction

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> project offers state-of-the-art software code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty
astrophysical systems, such as galaxies and accretion disks. <tt>SKIRT</tt> employs the Monte Carlo technique to
emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a
wealth of built-in geometries, light source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to
various mechanisms for importing models generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular
simulation is defined through a user-friendly command-line Q&A session, or with an optional graphical interface called
<tt>MakeUp</tt>.

\section Version9Features SKIRT features

Among other things, <tt>SKIRT</tt>:

 - Handles any 3D geometry without limitation.
 - Includes many built-in components to specify the distribution of stars and dust.
 - Allows importing the results of a hydrodynamic simulation in various SPH, AMR, or Voronoi formats.
 - Offers full treatment of multiple anisotropic scattering, absorption and (re-)emission by interstellar dust.
 - Computes the temperature distribution of the dust and the thermal dust re-emission self-consistently.
 - Handles any combination of dust mixtures, each with their own spatial distributions, and calculates
   the temperature of different grain size bins individually.
 - Takes into account the stochastic heating of small grains in non-equilibrium conditions.
 - Supports polarization of radiation by spherical dust grains.
 - Includes a suite of instruments mimicking astronomical instrumentation such as imaging and 3D spectroscopic devices.
 - Operates efficiently in both memory consumption and CPU time.
 - Is heavily parallelized, supporting any combination of multiple threads (shared memory) and multiple processes
   (distributed memory), including a data parallelization mode that substantially reduces memory requirements.
 - Allows specifying simulation parameters in an interactive console Q&A session, by straigthforward editing
   of XML-based parameter files, or through a graphical user interface.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> project source tree includes <tt>FitSKIRT</tt>, an extension of the <tt>SKIRT</tt> code that
automatically fits a 3D model to observed images of a dusty astrophysical object. <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> matches the output
frames of <tt>SKIRT</tt> radiative transfer simulations to the observed images, searching the model parameter space
through a genetic algorithm. For each new individual constructed by the genetic procedure, <tt>FitSKIRT</tt> performs a
<tt>SKIRT</tt> simulation using the parameters defined by the individual's genes. The resulting simulated images are
compared with the observed target images, and the result is fed back into the genetic algorithm as the quality measure
for the individual.

The <tt>SKIRT</tt> project is completely written in C++ and has been designed with well-defined programming interfaces
between components. Adding a new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically
adjusts to allow configuring the new options.

\section Version9Toolkit Python toolkit for SKIRT

As an other extension to <tt>SKIRT</tt>, the "Python Toolkit for SKIRT" (<tt>PTS</tt>) helps preprocess, postprocess
and visualize <tt>SKIRT</tt> data, and helps drive <tt>SKIRT</tt> simulations in various contexts. As its name implies,
<tt>PTS</tt> is written in Python. It is organized as a separate project source tree. Installing <tt>PTS</tt> is
optional -- you can perfectly run SKIRT without it.
