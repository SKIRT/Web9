\section StatusRoadmap9Status Status

<em>June 2019</em>

Version 9 of the SKIRT project has been publicly released and has reached a state where proof-reading, evaluation, and
further testing by any interested user is highly desired. SKIRT 9 properly performs 300 handcrafted test cases and
properly runs all benchmarks described in the SKIRT 8 web site section. However, many problems may be lurking under the
hood, waiting to surface when the code is put to more extensive use.

Unless noted otherwise (e.g. labeled as a future plan), the features described on this web site have been implemented
in the code and are ready for further verification. The major exception is that the tutorials and the benchmark results
are still missing. They should become available in the coming months.

\section StatusRoadmap9Roadmap Roadmap

There are still many items on our internal do list or wish list. Over time, the smaller ones will either be
accomplished or entered as a issue on GitHub (e.g. in the category feature suggestion), so that the information is
public and items may be picked up by any contributor.

The roadmap for larger development projects (planned, suggested, or under consideration) will be outlined here in
this web page section, once the remaining documentation has been completed as indicated above.

The core SKIRT team.
