<em>August 2, 2019</em>

Version 9 of the SKIRT project has been publicly released and has reached a state where proof-reading, evaluation, and
further testing by any interested user is highly desired. SKIRT 9 properly performs 300 handcrafted test cases and
properly runs all benchmarks described in the benchmark web site section. However, unknown problems may be lurking
under the hood, waiting to surface when the code is put to more extensive use.

\section StatusRoadmap9Roadmap Roadmap

There are still many items on our internal do list or wish list. Over time, the smaller ones will either be
accomplished or entered as a issue on GitHub (e.g. in the category feature suggestion), so that the information is
public and items may be picked up by any contributor.

The roadmap for larger development projects (planned, suggested, or under consideration) will be outlined here in
this web page section. This information will become available during the coming months.

The core SKIRT team.
