\section StatusRoadmap9Status Status

<em>August 26, 2019</em>

Version 9 of the SKIRT project has been publicly released a few months ago and has reached a state where it is ready to
be used for science projects. SKIRT 9 properly performs hundreds of handcrafted test cases and properly runs all
available benchmarks. SKIRT 9 and PTS 9 are fully documented, including up-to-date tutorials, concept notes and
reference material. This new version is now being used for its first actual science projects. However, unknown problems
may still be waiting to surface when the code is put to more extensive use. We therefore specifically invite you to
perform further testing, evaluation, and proof-reading, and we look forward to hearing from you.

\section StatusRoadmap9Roadmap Roadmap

There are still many items on our internal do list or wish list. Over time, the smaller ones will either be
accomplished or entered as a issue on GitHub (e.g. in the category feature suggestion), so that the information is
public and items may be picked up by any contributor.

The roadmap for larger development projects (planned, suggested, or under consideration) will be outlined here in
this web page section. This information will become available during the coming months.

The core SKIRT team.
