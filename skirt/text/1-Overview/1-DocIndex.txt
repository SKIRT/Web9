\page SKIRT SKIRT documentation index

The \c SKIRT documentation is structured as follows:

- <a href="../version9/_new_in_s_k_i_r_t9.html">What's new in SKIRT 9</a> presents the changes from SKIRT 8 to SKIRT 9.

<b> Part I: Guides -- overall guidance and tutorials. </b>

  - The \ref CodeOverview describes the various components of the \c SKIRT code.
  - \ref InstallationGuide provides installation instructions for the \c SKIRT code.
  - The <a href="../version9/_tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> introduce \c SKIRT
    through a number of detailed usage examples; highly recommended for new users.
  - \ref UserGuide offers more structured information on using the various components in the \c SKIRT code.
  - \ref DeveloperGuide offers guidelines on how to extend or adjust the \c SKIRT code.

<b> Part II: Concepts -- more in-depth information on selected topics. </b>

  - \ref Wavelengths discusses wavelength sampling and discretization in \c SKIRT.
  - \ref SpatialGrids introduces the spatial grids used for discretizing the transfer medium in \c SKIRT.
  - \ref DustProperties describes how \c SKIRT deals with optical and calorimetric dust properties.
  - \ref HydroImport presents \c SKIRT's capabilities for working with the results of hydrodynamical simulations.
  - \ref Redshift presents the \c SKIRT features related to models placed at nonzero redshift.
  - \ref Polarization describes the implementation of polarized radiation transfer in \c SKIRT.
  - \ref Lya presents SKIRT's capabilities for simulating Lyman-alpha line transfer.
  - \ref PerspectiveInstr provides details on \c SKIRT's perspective instrument, used mostly for making movies.
  - \ref Parallelization explains how \c SKIRT supports parallel computing.
  - \ref Cfitsio introduces the library included with \c SKIRT to read and write FITS files.
  - \ref VoroPlusPlus introduces the library included with \c SKIRT to construct Voronoi tesselations.

<b> Part III: Reference -- documentation on every class, namespace and function. </b>

The reference documentation can be accessed by selecting one of the corresponding tabs in the navigation bar at the top
of the page:

  - \em Classes: a list of all the classes in the \c SKIRT code.
    - The \em Class \em List subtab: an alphabetical list of all classes
    - The \em Class \em Index subtab: an alphabetical index of all classes
    - The \em Class \em Hierarchy subtab: inheritance diagrams for all classes
  - \em Namespaces: a list of the namespaces in the \c SKIRT code.
  - \em Macros: a list of the files defining macros in the \c SKIRT code.
