\page UserMakeUp Using MakeUp to configure SKIRT

\section UserMakeUpIntro Introduction

The \c MakeUp utility is an optional component of the \c SKIRT project that requires installation of the Qt libraries.
Assuming you have built \c MakeUp (see \ref InstallQt), you can create and edit parameter files for \c SKIRT through a
graphical wizard-like user interface.

\c MakeUp is built as a separate program, so it does not need to run on the same computer as the \c SKIRT command line
program. The consecutive wizard panes follow the same pattern as the Q&A session driven by the command-line program
(see \ref UserCmdLineInter), with important benefits offered by the graphical user interface:

- You can modify existing \em ski files without having to open them in a text
  editor and manually changing values. Sometimes changing a certain parameter requires other additional parameters to
  be set or others to be deleted from the parameter file, which is not easily done by hand. The \c MakeUp
  interface will automatically adapt its questions after you change such a parameter.
- You can go back to the preceding wizard panes. With the command line Q&A session, when you
  enter an incorrect value, you either have to abort the session and start over, or you have to remember to change the
  value once the parameter file has been created. And when you select a parameter value that influences the course of
  the session (e.g. you add the wrong type of geometry), you have no other choice than to start over.
- When adding components to a list (instruments, geometries, stellar or dust components), you get a visualization of
  the components already added. You also have the option to edit any component in the list, or to remove one.
- You can get context-sensitive help on the items and properties being configured through built-in links
  to the \c SKIRT web site.

\section UserMakeUpUsing Using MakeUp

Once the \c SKIRT project has been built with the appropriate build options (see \ref InstallQt), the executable for \c
MakeUp can be found in a directory called <tt>~/SKIRT/release/MakeUp/main</tt>. On some platforms, such as Mac OS X,
you can double-click the application icon to launch \c MakeUp. On other platforms, it has to be launched from the
command line (but there are no command line options).

When \c MakeUp is launched, the following window appears:

In this window, \c MakeUp offers the possibility of creating a new parameter file for \c SKIRT or editing an existing
one. Selecting one of the options and pressing "Continue" will take you into a wizard session that follows the same
pattern as the command line interface invoked by launching \c SKIRT in a Terminal window without command line
arguments. For example, while adding an instrument that records IFU data cubes, the wizard pane may look like this:

In the configuration pane for a particular property, there are two noteworthy user-assistance features:

- When you right-click on the text describing a property or option, \c MakeUp displays a context-sensitive popup menu
  with a list of help options. Selecting one of these options opens the corresponding online \c SKIRT documentation
  in your default web browser.
- The lower left corner of the \c MakeUp window shows the name and "path" of the property being configured
  as it would appear in a \em ski file. This can help locating the property in ski files for manual editing.

At the end of the session, a final wizard pane asks the user to save the new or adjusted configuration in a
parameter file on disk.
