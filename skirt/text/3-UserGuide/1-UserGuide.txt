/**

\page UserGuide The SKIRT User Guide

\note This user guide assumes that you have installed the \c SKIRT project on your computer as explained in the
\ref InstallationGuide.

The best way to begin using \c SKIRT is to perform the tutorials offered in the <a
href="../version9/_tutorials.html">Tutorials</a> section on this web site, and then to turn back to this user guide for
additional information and guidance.

Also, detailed information on a specific \c SKIRT option and its effect can be found in the documentation for the C++
class implementing the option. As explained in \ref UserParamFileEdit, the relevant class name (and hence the
corresponding documentation on the web site) is fairly easy to locate even for a non-developer.

The \c SKIRT user guide includes the following topics:

- <a href="../version9/_tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>
- \ref UserCmdLine
- \ref UserParamFile
- \ref UserMakeUp
- \ref UserMPI
