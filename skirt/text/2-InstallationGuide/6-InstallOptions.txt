\section InstallOptionsIntro Introduction to build options

The \c SKIRT build process is driven by the \c CMake utility, which supports many operating systems and
offers a flexible system to adjust a build to local requirements and circumstances. To this end, \c CMake manages
a set of "variables" that control the build process. In the context of the \c SKIRT code, we recognize
three categories of \c CMake variables:

- Primary build options to include additional programs or to enable extra capabilities (the "out-of-the-box" \c SKIRT
  code configuration builds just the \c SKIRT command-line program without external dependencies). The variable
  names for these options start with "BUILD_".
- Secondary build options for which \c CMake usually finds the appropriate values, but which can be adjusted by the
  user if needed. For example, there is a build option to specify the path to the C++ compiler used for the code.
- Advanced variables which are almost never to be touched by a user, and which are displayed by \c CMake only upon
  special request.

The table in the following section includes the primary and secondary build options relevant for building the \c SKIRT
code. If the need should ever arise for adjusting an advanced variable, your favorite web search engine will
hopefully guide you to the answer.

</TABLE>

(*) \em auto means that \c CMake usually finds the appropriate path without user intervention. In case \c CMake fails
(e.g. the proposed path is empty, contains a string such as "NOTFOUND", or points to the wrong executable or library),
you can manually override the value of the variable with the correct path.
