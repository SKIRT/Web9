\page InstallationGuide The SKIRT Installation Guide

\section InstallReq System requirements

The \c SKIRT code is intended to be truly cross-platform. It is written in standard C++14, which is supported by all
recent C++ compilers, and it uses the \c CMake build system, which is widely available. As a result, the \c SKIRT
code should compile and run on any recent 64-bit version of Unix, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.

The source code for \c SKIRT is hosted on GitHub. You can download the code as a ZIP archive, but the
recommended method is to use a \em git client, which is widely available. The documentation on this web site is
generated from the source code through \em Doxygen. You don't need to install Doxygen and the related tools unless you
are a substantial contributor to the SKIRT project.

The default and most basic build configuration includes a fully-functional version of the \c SKIRT command-line program
with support for multiple parallel threads in a single process. In this configuration, the code has no external
dependencies other than the C++ compiler and the \c CMake build tool. Additional capabilities that may depend on
external components can be enabled through user-configurable build options:

- To enable the multi-processing capabilities of \c SKIRT, the host system must provide an implementation of the
standard Message Passing Interface (MPI).

- The optional \c MakeUp utility uses the Qt development environment to implement its graphical user interface, so a
recent version of the Qt framework must be installed to build this utility.


\section InstallTypes Types of installation

Your approach to installing the \c SKIRT code depends on your usage intentions and computer system.
We can recognize two main types of environment:

- A laptop or desktop computer running Mac OS X, a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, or Microsoft Windows. In this
environment you are likely to select tools that offer a graphical user interface. If you'd like to manage \c SKIRT
configuration files with the graphical wizard offered by the \c MakeUp tool, then you need to install the
Qt libraries. In that case, you can just as well use Qt Creator to build the \c SKIRT code. Alternatively, you can
perform certain tasks on the command line or even skip graphical user interfaces entirely.

- A remote server, most likely running a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Scientific Linux, or some proprietary
Unix flavor. In this environment you are likely to perform most or all tasks on the command line, although it is often
possible to use graphical interfaces through a remote windowing system.
