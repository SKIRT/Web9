\section DownloadsResources SKIRT resource packs

Many built-in SKIRT features require the presence of one or more resource files containing tabulated data (e.g., source
spectra or dust properties). To avoid overloading the source code repository with potentially large data files, these
resources must be downloaded seperately, in addition to cloning the SKIRT source code repository and building the
executable. On Linux and Mac OS X systems, the convenience shell script \c downloadResources.sh provided in the SKIRT
git directory automatically downloads and installs the expected resource pack(s). As an alternative, or for operating
systems not supported by the script, the resource packs can be manually downloaded here. Refer to the SKIRT
installation guide for further instructions.
