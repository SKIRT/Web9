\page InstallMac Installing Anaconda on Mac OS X

The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is an open source Python distribution that includes
an extensive Python package manager. It offers many additional features, including the option to define and switch
between multiple Python environments. This allows, for example, Python 2 and Python 3 versions to coexist peacefully on
the same computer.
This page describes how to install Anaconda using the graphical installer on Mac OS X. The installation procedure using
the graphical installer on other operating systems is probably very similar.


\section InstallMacDistrib The Anaconda distribution

To install the Anaconda distribution, follow the steps outlined below.

- Visit the Anaconda distribution page at https://www.anaconda.com/distribution

- Locate and click the appropriate download link for:
   - the graphical installer
   - Python 3.7 or higher (i.e. Anaconda3)
   - your operating system (Mac OS X in our example)

- After the download completes, locate and launch the installer (probably named similar to
  \c Anaconda3-2019.03-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)

- Follow the instructions displayed by the installer, entering your password as required, and ignoring any optional
  extras. When quitting the installer, you can tell the installer to trash itself or you can do this later.

- Locate the application \c Anaconda-Navigator.app in your Applications folder, and launch it.

- In the main Anaconda Navigator window, select the "Environments" tab in the column at the left and then
  select the default and only "base (root)" environment (do \em not click the triangular "run" button!).
  You should now see a list of already installed Python packages similar to the example below.

- Scroll through the "Installed" list to verify that it includes all packages required by PTS; see \ref InstallPackages
  for more information.

- Install any missing packages using the procedure described in the following section.

\note The Anaconda installer adds several lines of commands to your login script; do \em not remove these lines.


\section InstallMacPacks Extra Python packages

To install extra Python packages in your Anaconda environment, follow the steps outlined below.

- If you haven't already done so, launch the application \c Anaconda-Navigator.app in your Applications folder.

- In the main Anaconda Navigator window, select the "Environments" tab in the column at the left and then
  select the default and only "base (root)" environment (do \em not click the triangular "run" button!).
  You should now see a list of already installed Python packages similar to the example shown above.

- If it has been a while since you first installed Anaconda, press the "Update index" button at the top to
  retrieve the most recent list of available packages.

- In the popup box at the top, now showing "Installed", select "Not installed" instead.

- In the search field to the far right of the popup box, enter (part of) the name of the package to be installed.
  Select the appropriate package in the list by clicking the checkbox in front of the package name.

- Press the green Apply button at the bottom. A dialog window will be displayed listing the requested package and
  any of its dependencies. Press Apply once more in the dialog window to install all listed packages.

- Repeat the previous two steps to install additional packages, or select multiple packages before pressing Apply
  to install all of them in one go.


\section InstallMacFinal Finalizing the PTS installation

After completing the Anaconda installation procedures described in the previous sections, open a new Terminal window
(so that the commands added to your login script by the Anaconda installer get executed) and enter "python".
The welcome prompt should now list the Python version you just installed (i.e. version 3.7 or higher) and it should
include the name Anaconda.

You are now ready to install \c PTS as described in \ref InstallPTS.
