\page InstallationGuide The PTS Installation Guide

\section InstallRequirements System requirements

\c PTS is written in Python 3.7 and thus requires a Python distribution for language version 3.7 or later to be
installed on the host computer. In addition to the functionality offered by the Python standard library packages, \c
PTS also depends on some non-standard but commonly available packages (see \ref InstallPackages). Usually, these
packages can be easily obtained through the Python package manager included with the installed Python distribution.

This version of \c PTS has been tested on Mac OS X 10.14 (Mojave) and on the Linux distribution Ubuntu 16.04 (64-bit).
However, \c PTS should run on any Unix system that has a proper version of Python installed. At this time, \c PTS has
not been tested on Microsoft Windows systems, however should the need arise this could probably be supported with only
a small effort.

To run \c SKIRT on your computer in addition to (or in conjunction with) \c PTS, you need to obtain the \c SKIRT source
code and build the executable as described in the \c SKIRT installation guide. Alternatively, you can use \c PTS to
pre- or post-process \c SKIRT related data on one computer and actually run the \c SKIRT simulations on another
computer.

\section InstallProcedures Installation procedures

Getting \c PTS to work on your computer consists of two essential steps:
  - Installing an appropriate Python distribution, including the required third-party Python packages.
  - Cloning the \c PTS source code repository and adding some aliases to the login procedure.

As indicated above, any Python distribution including Python 3.7 or later should work, assuming the required
third-party Python packages (see \ref InstallPackages) can be added when needed. This guide offers instructions for
installing the Anaconda Python distribution in two scenarios: using a graphical user interface installer on Mac OS X
and using the command line on Ubuntu. The procedure for other operation systems and Python distributions can probably
(hopefully) be inferred from these examples.

This guide is organized in the following topics:
- \ref InstallMac (using a graphical user interface)
- \ref InstallUbuntu (using the command line)
- \ref InstallPTS
- \ref InstallPackages
