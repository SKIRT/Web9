\page InstallPackages Required Python packages

In addition to using the standard Python 3.7 packages, the \c PTS facilities depend on some non-standard but readily
available third-party Python packages. Usually, these packages can be easily obtained through the Python package
manager included with the Python distribution installed on your computer.

To obtain a list of the current (direct) package dependencies, make sure that \c PTS is properly installed and enter
the following terminal command:

    pts list_dependencies

The table below lists the non-standard packages that are required at the time of writing. For each package, the table
also indicates the version used for testing the \c PTS features using the package. Note that each of these packages
may have additional dependencies, requiring other packages to be installed as well.
