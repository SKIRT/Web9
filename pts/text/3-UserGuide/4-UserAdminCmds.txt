\page UserAdminCmds Administrative PTS commands

The Python scripts residing in the \c do sub-directory of the \c admin package implement administrative commands. Some
of these commands, such a those creating backup archives, have been written for use by the core \c SKIRT team and may
be of limited value to other users. This page introduces the administrative commands that are likely to have a broader
application domain. For more details, or for information on the other administrative commands, see the reference
documentation of the pts.admin.do sub-package.


\section UserAdminCmdsDeps Listing dependencies

While installing \c PTS, or when new versions of \c PTS with extended functionality become available, it is important
to ensure that all third-party Python packages on which the \c PTS code depends are installed. To assist with this
process, the \c list_dependencies command script lists all packages referred to by the \c PTS code, including
an indication of whether each package is already available or not:

    $ pts list_dependencies
      Starting admin/list_dependencies...
      PTS depends on 32 packages:
        argparse -- installed
        astropy -- installed
        datetime -- installed
        ...
    !   reportlab -- NOT INSTALLED
        ...
        scipy -- installed
        zipfile -- installed
     Finished admin/list_dependencies.

The list includes both standard and third-party packages. Because the standard packages are built into the regular
Python distribution, they will always be marked as "installed".


\section UserAdminCmdsCmds Listing PTS commands

The \c list_commands command lists all available \c PTS commands with a brief description of their function. In other
words, it provides a quick \c PTS command reference:

    $ pts list_commands
      Starting admin/list_commands...
      Package admin:
        admin/list_commands: list all PTS command scripts
        admin/list_dependencies: list external package dependencies for PTS
        admin/remove_pyc: remove all compiled Python files from the local PTS repository
        ...
      Package visual:
        visual/make_images: create RGB images for surface brightness maps generated by SKIRT instruments
        visual/plot_bands: plot built-in broadbands in a given wavelength range
        visual/plot_density_cuts: plot the planar cuts through the medium density in one or more SKIRT simulations
        ...
      Finished admin/list_commands.

\section UserAdminCmdsCache Removing Python cache files

This command script removes all compiled Python files (\c *.pyc files and \c \_\_pycache\_\_ directories) from the
local \c PTS repository. Although these files are ignored by git, removing them can be useful to clean the local
repository after one or more Python source files have been relocated or renamed.
