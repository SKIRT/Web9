\page UserVisualCmds PTS commands for visualizing SKIRT results

The Python scripts residing in the \c do sub-directory of the \c visual package implement commands for visualizing
SKIRT-related data through plots (e.g. spectra) and images (e.g. data frames). This page introduces some of these
commands. For more details, or for information on the other administrative commands, see the reference documentation of
the pts.visual.do sub-package. For more introductory material, have a look at the \c SKIRT/PTS
<a href="../version9/_tutorials.html">Tutorials</a>


\section UserVisualCmdsDensity Density cuts

The \c plot_density_cuts command script creates plots of media density cuts generated by the
DefaultMediaDensityCutsProbe in a \c SKIRT simulation, allowing a visual comparison between the theoretical and
spatially gridded medium density distribution. The script requires that the simulation includes exactly one
DefaultMediaDensityCutsProbe.

The script takes the following arguments:
 - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
                                                or "." for the current directory
 - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
 - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be included in the density range (color bar); default is 5

The plot file is placed next to the simulation output file(s) being handled. The filename includes the simulation
prefix, the probe name, and the medium and cut indicators, and has the ".pdf" filename extension.

For example, after running a simulation of a model with dust distributed as a broken exponential disk:

    $ pts plot_dens . --dex=8
      Starting visual/plot_density_cuts...
      Created .../mg2_cut_dust_xy.pdf
      Created .../mg2_cut_dust_xz.pdf
      Finished visual/plot_density_cuts.
    $ open mg2_cut_dust_xz.pdf

Quite obviously, this simulation was run with a poor-resolution spatial grid.


\section UserVisualCmdsImages RGB images

The \c make_images command script creates RGB images in PNG format for the surface brightness maps produced by the
instruments of a \c SKIRT simulation. The R,G,B color channels can be specified as wavelength values or as broadbands.

The script takes the following arguments:
 - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
                                                or "." for the current directory.
 - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory.
 - \em type (string): the final segment of the name of the instrument output files to be handled, excluding the
       ".fits" suffix (for example, "primaryscattered"); by default the script handles the "total" output files.
 - \em name (string): a name that will be added to the end of the image file name; defaults to the empty string.
 - \em colors (string): a string specifying the three wavelength values or broadbands corresponding to each R,G,B
    color channel of the image; by default the script uses frames with wavelengths as widely apart as possible.

The image files are  placed next to the "*.fits" file(s) being represented, with the same filename
but extended with the specified \em name string and the filename extension replaced by ".png".

For example, after running a panchromatic simulation of a spiral galaxy model with a substantial amount of dust:

    $ pts make_images . --name=optical --colors="SDSS_Z,SDSS_R,SDSS_U"
      Starting visual/make_images...
      Convolving for RGB image diskemi_i88_total_optical
      Created convolved RGB image file /Users/pcamps/SKIRT/SKIRT9/run/diskemi_i88_total_optical.png
      Finished visual/make_images.
    $ pts make_images . --name=fir --colors="PACS_160,PACS_100,PACS_70"
      Starting visual/make_images...
      Convolving for RGB image diskemi_i88_total_fir
      Created convolved RGB image file /Users/pcamps/SKIRT/SKIRT9/run/diskemi_i88_total_fir.png
      Finished visual/make_images.
    $ open diskemi_i88_total_optical.png

\section UserVisualCmdsSpectra Spectra

The \c plot_seds command script creates plots of the SEDs produced by the instruments of a \c SKIRT simulation.

The script takes the following arguments:
 - \em simDirPath (positional string argument): the path to the SKIRT simulation output directory,
                                                or "." for the current directory
 - \em prefix (string): the prefix of the simulation to handle; by default handles all simulations in the directory
 - \em wmin (float): smallest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 0.1 micron
 - \em wmax (float): largest wavelength on the horizontal axis, in micron; default is 1000 micron
 - \em dex (float): if specified, the number of decades to be plotted on the vertical axis; default is 5

The plot files are placed next to the "*_sed.dat" file(s) being represented. The filename starts
with the simulation prefix and ends with "sed.pdf".

For example, after running a panchromatic simulation of a model with a substantial amount of dust:

    $ pts plot_sed . --wmax=2000 --dex=4.5
      Starting visual/plot_seds...
      Created .../diskemi_sed.pdf
      Finished visual/plot_seds.
    $ open diskemi_sed.pdf

\section UserVisualCmdsBands Broadband transmission curves

\c PTS offers a set of built-in transmission curves corresponding to standard broadband filters and instruments; see
pts.band.broadband.BroadBand for more information. These transmission curves can be used, for example, for calculating
convolutions with a given spectrum, or for obtaining the pivot wavelength of a band. Also, the same broadbands are
implemented by the BroadBand class in \c SKIRT.

The \c list_bands command script lists the names of all built-in broadbands with their corresponding pivot wavelength.
The bands are sorted on pivot wavelength within each band family:

    $ pts list_bands
      Starting band/list_bands...
      There are 75 built-in bands:
      | Band name          | Pivot wavelength
      |--------------------|-----------------
      | 2MASS_2MASS_J      | 1.2393 micron
      | 2MASS_2MASS_H      | 1.6495 micron
      | 2MASS_2MASS_KS     | 2.1639 micron
      ...
      | WISE_WISE_W3       | 12.568 micron
      | WISE_WISE_W4       | 22.314 micron
      |--------------------|-----------------
      Finished band/list_bands.

The \c plot_bands command script creates a plot of the transmission curves for all built-in broadbands that satisfy
all of the selection criteria specified as optional arguments:
  - \em wmin (float): if specified, the pivot wavelength must exceed this value
  - \em wmax (float): if specified, the pivot wavelength must be lower than this value
  - \em names (string with comma-separated segments): if specified, the band name must contain
    at least one of these segments

The resulting plot file is named "FigBuiltinBands.pdf" and is placed in the current working directory.

For example:

    $ pts plot_bands --names="spitzer,herschel"
      Starting visual/plot_bands...
      Plotting 13 built-in bands...
      Created .../FigBuiltinBands.pdf
      Finished visual/plot_bands.
    $ open FigBuiltinBands.pdf
