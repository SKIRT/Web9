\page Benchmarks Benchmarks

\c SKIRT properly performs the major benchmarks published in the field to which the code is applicable, i.e. continuum
dust radiative transfer for astrophysical systems. In fact, the \c SKIRT team participated in several recent benchmark
efforts. The geometries, source spectra and dust properties needed for these benchmarks are built into \c SKIRT, so you
can run them without changing the code. The \c SKIRT configuration file (\em ski file) for each benchmark is offered
for download on the corresponding page:
