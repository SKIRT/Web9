\section GordonIntro Introduction

Gordon et al. 2017 present a 3D continuum radiative transfer benchmark problem composed of a slab of dust with uniform
density externally illuminated by a star. The aim is to test dust absorption, scattering, and emission, optionally
taking into account stochastic heating of dust grains in non-LTE conditions (see \ref Camps2015). The authors
provide results produced by seven different radiative transfer codes, including \c SKIRT, for several optical depths
and viewing angles.

\section GordonResults SKIRT results

The diagram below on the left illustrates the benchmark setup including the viewing angles. The figure on the right
shows the SEDs calculated taking into account stochastic heating for all optical depth values in the benchmark and for
selected viewing angles.

The figure below shows images produced by \c SKIRT for the \f$\tau_z(1~\mu\text{m}) = 0.1\f$ case calculated taking
into account stochastic heating for two representative wavelengths.

Many more results and comparisons between the results produced by \c SKIRT 8 and the other participating codes are
presented in the benchmark paper (see \ref GordonRefs). The figures below present a comparison of the results produced
by the more recent \c SKIRT 9 with those of three other codes participating in the benchmark, for a specific
benchmark configuration (stochastic heating, optical depth \f$\tau_z(1~\mu\text{m}) = 0.1\f$, viewing angle
\f$\theta = 180^\circ\f$, and for the images, wavelength \f$\lambda = 0.15\,\mu\mathrm{m}\f$).

\section GordonPerform Performing this benchmark

To perform this benchmark, download the ski file and wavelength data files provided above (\ref GordonRefs). Open the ski
file in a text editor to adjust the following parameter values to a particular benchmark configuration:

| Parameter         | XML element                              | XML attribute        |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Emission type     | \c DustEmissionOptions                   | \em dustEmissionType |
| Wavelength grid   | \c FileWavelengthGrid (5 times)          | \em filename         |
| Optical depth     | \c OpticalDepthMaterialNormalization     | \em opticalDepth     |
| Number of dust grid bins along Z-axis     | \c meshZ/LinMesh | \em numBins          |
| Number of pixels in the instrument frames | \c FullInstrument (7 times) | \em numPixelsX ; \em numPixelsY |
| Nr of photon packets | \c MonteCarloSimulation               | \em numPackets       |

The emission type can be one of two values, with a corresponding value for the wavelength grid (the spectral features
resulting from stochastic heating would not be resolved on the lower resolution "basic" wavelength grid):

| Emission type | Wavelength grid | Description |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Equilibrium   | gordon_wavelengths_basic.dat | Assume dust grains to be in equilibrium with radiation field |
| Stochastic    | gordon_wavelengths_full.dat  | Take into account stochastic heating of smaller dust grains |

To ensure correct results for the benchmark configuration with the highest optical depth, the dust grid resolution must
be increased. At the same time, the instrument resolution is increased to properly show the resulting surface
brightness gradients. The appropriate values are:

| Optical depth | Dust grid bins along Z-axis | Pixels in instrument frames |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
|  0.01 |  31 | 300 |
|  0.1  |  31 | 300 |
|  1    |  31 | 300 |
| 10    | 201 | 600 |

Finally, the number of photon packets should be adjusted depending on the benchmark configuration. The table below
lists the values used for producing "official" benchmark results. For the higher optical depths, these values lead
to long execution times.

| Optical depth | Equilibrium | Stochastic |
|---------------|-------------|------------|
|  0.01 |  1e10 |  2e10 |
|  0.1  |  1e10 |  2e10 |
|  1    |  3e10 |  6e10 |
| 10    | 10e10 | 20e10 |

Finally, pass the (name of) the ski file to \c SKIRT as a single command line argument. At the end of the simulation
run, \c SKIRT outputs data cubes and SEDs which can be compared to the original benchmark results.
