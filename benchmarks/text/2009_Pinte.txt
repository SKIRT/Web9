\page Pinte2009 Polarization from scattering in an axisymmetric dust disk

\section PinteIntro Introduction

Pinte et al. 2009 present a 2D continuum radiative transfer benchmark that includes the effects of polarization for
anisotropic scattering by spherical dust grains. The test configuration is a star embedded in a circumstellar disk with
an inner cavity free of dust. This configuration is similar to that used by Pascucci et al. 2004 (\ref Pascucci2004)
but it has a smaller central cavity and a steeper radial density gradient, making the problem more difficult to solve.
The dust grains are assumed to be spherical particles with a single size composed of astronomical silicates, so that
the scattering and polarization properties can be calculated using Mie theory.

\section PinteResults SKIRT results

The figure below, comparable to Figure 7 of Peest et al. 2017 (see also \ref Peest2017), shows polarization results
produced by \c SKIRT for a disk with an edge-on optical depth of \f$\tau=10^6\f$, at the inclinations \f$69.5^\circ\f$
(top half) and \f$87.1^\circ\f$ (bottom half). On the left are the linear polarization degree maps produced by \c
SKIRT. The dust grain size is the same as the wavelength (1 Î¼m), creating the intricate patterns in the maps. On the
right are cuts 1 to 6 through the maps along with results produced by some of the codes participating in the original
benchmark.

\section PintePerform Performing this benchmark

To perform this benchmark, download the ski file provided above (\ref PinteRefs). Then pass the (name of) the ski file
to \c SKIRT as a single command line argument. At the end of the simulation run, \c SKIRT outputs data frames and SEDs
including the elements of the Stokes vector carring the polarization state. This information can be compared to the
original benchmark results.
