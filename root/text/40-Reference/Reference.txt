\page Reference Reference Overview

This area of the web site provides detailed reference documentation that has been automatically derived from the source
code. For introductory information and advanced guidance, see \ref Documentation.


<H2>SKIRT Reference</H2>

The SKIRT reference material includes detailed documentation for every class, namespace, function, and macro defined
in the SKIRT C++ code. The following entry points into the documentation are provided:

- <a href="../skirt9/classes.html">Class Index</a>: a compact, multi-column list of all classes.
- <a href="../skirt9/inherits.html">Class Hierarchy</a>: the inheritance trees for all classes.
- <a href="../skirt9/annotated.html">Class List</a>: a single-column list of all classes.
- <a href="../skirt9/namespaces.html">Namespace List</a>: a list of all namespaces.
- <a href="../skirt9/files.html">Macro List</a>: a list of header files defining macros.

Note that namespaces are listed separately and thus are not included in the class index and list. This can be confusing
because a set of related "static" functions could be implemented as a namespace (e.g., SpecialFunctions) or as a class
(e.g., NR), requiring the user to look for the entity in two lists.


<H2>Ski File Reference</H2>

The ski file reference material comes in very handy when manually adjusting a ski file. It includes two (long) pages:

- \ref SkiFileHelpSubclasses "": for each base class that may occur in a ski file, a list of available subclasses.
- \ref SkiFileHelpProperties "": for each concrete class that may occur in a ski file, a list of supported properties
       including those inherited from super classes.


<H2>PTS Reference</H2>

The Python Toolkit for SKIRT (PTS) reference material includes detailed documentation for every package, class and
function defined in the PTS Python code. There is a single entry point into the documentation:

- <a href="../pts9/namespaces.html">PTS Reference</a>: a hierarchical list of packages, classes, and functions.
