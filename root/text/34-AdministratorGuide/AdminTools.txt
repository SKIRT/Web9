## Portability issues

As of this writing, SKIRT administration has been performed on macOS with Qt Creator as a development environment. It
is recommended to use the same setup unless there are good reasons to do otherwise.

If necessary, using another Unix-based operating system is probably feasible with limited work. Similarly, building
SKIRT through the command line interface (shell scripts) instead of Qt Creator should work fine. However, building the
MakeUp utility requires the Qt libraries anyway, so one can then simply install Qt Creator as well.

Here is a list of known portability issues; most likely there will be others:

- The shell scripts used for interacting with the Ghent University servers contain macOS specific commands.

- Some of the PTS command line operations related to administration automatically locate the relevant components
  in the SKIRT directory hierarchy relative to the user's home directory. This may fail on other systems.

- For a significant fraction of the functional tests, the precise results depend on the C/C++ run-time environment,
  which differs between operating systems and compilers. As a result, annoyingly, the reference files provided for the
  functional tests are not portable. The reason for these discrepancies is that the C/C++ standard allows the output of
  goniometric functions (and perhaps other mathematical functions) to differ in the least-significant bit. This tiny
  difference suffices for the SKIRT photon packets to follow a slightly different path, and thus produce different
  results.


## Software tools

As an administrator you need essentially all software tools mentioned in the SKIRT \ref InstallationGuide.
Assuming macOS and Qt Creator, this means you need to install the tools listed in the following table.

\note To clone the SKIRT and/or PTS respositories, do not follow the instructions in the regular installation guide.
Instead, follow the procedure prescribed in the topic \ref AdminStruct.
