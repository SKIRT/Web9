\note This guide is intended for members of the Core SKIRT Team who are responsible for managing the SKIRT project and
its online presence. It is of no interest to other users.

The topics in the administrator guide are organized in three chapters: background information, setting up, and regular
operation.


##Background information

To become an administrator you should be an experienced SKIRT user and an at least occasional SKIRT developer, so that
you already have a working knowledge of many of the relevant subjects. In any case, the following topics provided by
other areas of this web site are of special interest to an administrator. You should carefully review them before
proceeding.

- \ref UserComponents
- \ref DevStructSKIRT
- \ref DevStructPTS
- \ref DevCoding
- \ref DevCodingPTS

## Setting up

As an administrator you need write access to the relevant servers, and you need a very complete SKIRT project and
tooling installation on your computer. This section provides guidance on how to accomplish this setup.

  - Updating the SKIRT code: pull requests, functional tests, resource packs, web site
