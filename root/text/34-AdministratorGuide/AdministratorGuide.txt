\page AdministratorGuide Administrator Guide

This guide is intended for members of the Core SKIRT Team who are responsible for managing the SKIRT project and its
online presence. It is of no interest to other users because, for example, it assumes write access to the relevant
servers.

Topics covered:
  - \ref AdminPresence
  - Github: organization, repositories, teams
  - UGent servers: web site, resource and document server
  - Local prerequisites and directory structure
  - Updating the SKIRT code: pull requests, functional tests, resource packs, web site
  - Backups
