/**

\page AdminPresence Write access to the SKIRT project's online presence


## GitHub

The SKIRT project's code repositories are hosted on the GitHub platform as part of a GitHub \em organization called \c
SKIRT with URL https://github.com/SKIRT. The organization has two teams: Core and Contributor. A SKIRT project
administrator must have a GitHub account that has been setup as a member of the Core team with Owner access rights.
This can only be done by another administrator.

## Web site

The SKIRT web site with public URL www.skirt.ugent.be is hosted on the Ghent University web server. It can be reached
as a shared disk through the internal university network using "smb://UGENT\USER@files.ugent.be/USER/www/shares/skirt"
(after replacing USER by your user name). Access can be granted only by the university's DICT department.

## Data

Extra data files are hosted on the Ghent University data file server. The SKIRT section has been setup with public URL
https://sciences.ugent.be/skirtextdat/ and it can be reached as a shared disk through the internal university network
using "smb://UGENT\USER@files.ugent.be/USER/shares/skirtextdat" (after replacing USER by your user name). Access can be
granted only by the university's DICT department.

## Backup

While the code repositories are automatically backed up by GitHub (one would hope), other data relevant to the SKIRT
project must be backed up manually on some meaningful schedule. Ghent University provides a backup server for this
purpose, which can be reached as a shared disk through the internal university network using
"smb://UGENT\USER@files.ugent.be/USER/shares/vakgroep/astro_skirt/USER" (after replacing USER by your user name).
Access can be granted only by the university's DICT department.
