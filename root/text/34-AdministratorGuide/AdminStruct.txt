\page AdminStruct SKIRT project directory structure

An administator's SKIRT project directory must be complete and have the exact structure described below. This is
important because the administator shell scripts and PTS commands rely on this structure. For example, the contents of
the SKIRT web site is derived from sources and data spread out across many of the project's subdirectories.

# The SKIRT project directory

    SKIRT
        Backup
        Benchmark9
        Functional9
        PTS9
        Resources9
        ResourcesC
        SKIRT9
        Web9

The top level directory for the SKIRT project is called SKIRT and resides directly in the administator's home folder,
i.e. at the highest level. Its subdirectories, shown above in alphabetical order, are described in the following
sections.

When setting up this directory structure:

- The SKIRT9, PTS9, and Web9 directory contents should be cloned from the corresponding GitHub repositories in the
  manner described below for each directory (\em not following the installation instructions for a regular user).

- The contents of the other directories must be obtained from a current backup created by another administrator.

\note There are currently no provisions for synchronizing the contents of the non-GitHub directories between multiple
administrators/computers. The most straighforward manual synchronization technique is to ensure that (1) just a single
administrator is making changes at any one time, and (2) backups of the most recent version are exchanged when
transitioning between administrators.

# Directories obtained from GitHub

The SKIRT9 and PTS9 repositories follow the GitHub \em fork \em and \em pull workflow model. This means you should \em
never push any changes directly to these repositories. Let us repeat this. You should <b>never</b> push any changes
directly to the SKIRT9 and PTS9 repositories. Instead, contributors <b>including administrators</b> push suggested
changes to their own fork and initiate a pull request. After approval, an administrator then merges the pull request to
the master branch in the main SKIRT9 or PTS9 repository. For more information, see \ref DevGitHubFlow.

The Web9 repository currently does not follow this workflow model because the administrator is the sole contributor.
In other words, until this policy is modified, you can push any updates directly to the Web9 repository.


## SKIRT9

As an administrator, your local copy of the SKIRT code must be connected to both the main SKIRT9 repository and your
own fork of this repository. This is accomplished as follows.

# Directories obtained from administrator backups

## Backup

    Backup
        create_backup.txt
        Backup--2025-07-12--10-09-27

This directory contains information related to backing up the SKIRT project. Specifically:

- the \c create_backup.txt text file provides manually edited instructions for the PTS create_backup command,
  essentially describing the type of information residing in each of the SKIRT project subdirectories.

- The \c Backup--* directories, if present, contain backup ZIP archives created by the PTS create_backup command.
  After moving the backups in these directories to an off-line backup location, the local copies can be deleted.

For more information, see:

- Administrator guide: \ref AdminBackup
- PTS reference: pts.admin.do.create_backup


## Benchmark9

    Benchmark9
        _ReadMe.txt
        1997_Ivezic
        2002_vanZadelhoff_1
        ...
        XRAY3_ISMDUST
        XRAY4_RXTORUS

This directory contains all documentation, runtime specifications, and reference results for the formal benchmarks
comparing SKIRT output to published results. For more information, see:

- Administrator guide: \ref AdminBenchmarks
- Community info: \ref Benchmarks
- The \c _ReadMe.txt text file in the Benchmark9 directory


## Functional9

    Functional9
        _testreports
        Cosmology
        Emission
        ...
        Units
        WavelengthDistributions
        WavelengthGrids

This directory contains the specifications and reference results for over 800 functional tests that can be run and
verified automatically to avoid regression after each update or addition to the SKIRT code. For more information, see:

- Administrator guide: \ref AdminFunTests
- PTS reference: pts.test.do.test_functional
- PTS reference: pts.test.functional.SkirtTestSuite


## Resources9

    Resources9
        OriginalData
        Publish
        StoredTables

This directory contains all data related to the resources used by the SKIRT code. This includes the orginal data
obtained from a third party where applicable, the corresponding "stored table" files consumed by SKIRT, the resource
packs to be made available for public download, the specifications for converting between these formats, and the
procedures for publishing the resource packs to the SKIRT data file server. For more information, see:

- Administrator guide: \ref AdminResources
- PTS reference: pts.admin.do.create_resource_archives
- PTS reference: pts.storedtable.do.construct_skirt_resources


## ResourcesC

    ResourcesC
        Benchmarks
        DustPediaData
        Publications
        Publish
        Tutorials

This directory contains all data files referenced from the web site and published on the SKIRT data file server (other
than the resource packs discussed in the previous section). This includes example ski files referenced from benchmark
descriptions or tutorials, and a copy of papers listed in the web site's publications section. For more information,
see:
