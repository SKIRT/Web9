/**

\page Benchmarks Benchmarks

SKIRT properly performs the major benchmarks published in the areas to which the code is applicable. The geometries,
source spectra and medium properties needed for all of these benchmarks are built into SKIRT, so you can run them
without changing the code. The SKIRT configuration file (\em ski file) for each benchmark is offered for download on
the corresponding page.
