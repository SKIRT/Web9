\page VanderMeulen2023 X-ray reprocessing by smooth torus

\section VanderMeulenIntro Introduction

Vander Meulen et al. 2023 describe the X-ray implementation in SKIRT and perform a number of benchmark tests, comparing
the SKIRT simulation results to the published results of other codes to verify its operation. This web page discusses
the RXTORUS benchmark test, presented in their section 4.2.2, which compares the results for a smooth torus model
originally calculated with the REFLEX code (Paltani & Ricci 2017). REFLEX implements a complete set of X-ray physics in
cold-gas media, including bound-electron scattering and a large collection of fluorescent line transitions. It
implements the same interaction cross sections as those that are incorporated in SKIRT, forming an ideal reference for
benchmarking these processes.

\section VanderMeulenResults Benchmark results

\subsection VanderMeulenResultsOverall Overall comparison

The RXTORUS model represents a ring torus of cold gas with a uniform density and a variable covering factor, which
models scattering on bound electrons in addition to photo-absorption and fluorescence. We reproduce the RXTORUS model
in SKIRT with a uniform ring torus of cold gas centered around an X-ray point source. We fix the torus opening angle to
60 deg, and run SKIRT simulations for an unobscured (i = 45 deg) and an obscured (i = 75 deg) sightline. The equatorial
hydrogen column density of the torus is varied between \f$10^{22}\f$ and \f$10^{25}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$, which are the
\f$N_\mathrm{H}\f$-limits of the RXTORUS model. The following figure compares the SKIRT and REFLEX results.

The results are found to be in excellent agreement over the entire simulation domain, for both sightlines and all
considered column densities. The noise levels in the SKIRT results are significantly lower, in part because of the
generic optimisation mechanisms implemented in SKIRT. Furthermore, the simulated SKIRT spectra have a much higher
spectral resolution, producing narrower fluorescent lines and smoother reflection continua.

\subsection VanderMeulenResultsZoom Zoom on narrow spectral range

The following figure shows a zoom into the important 6.0 to 7.5 keV spectral range for the same ring torus model with
\f$N_\mathrm{H} = 10^{24}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$ and i = 45 deg. This spectral range contains the three most prominent
fluorescent lines (Fe Kα, Fe Kβ, and Ni Kα), plus the Fe Kα Compton shoulder.

Despite the limited spectral resolution of the REFLEX results, we distinguish clear Compton shoulders in both
simulations, with similar strengths and consistent spectral shapes.


\section VanderMeulenPerform Performing this benchmark

To perform this benchmark, download the ski files, input spectrum, and wavelength grid data files provided above in
\ref VanderMeulenRefs.

To reproduce the results discussed above in \ref VanderMeulenResultsOverall, make a copy of the \c RXTORUS.ski file
with a descriptive name for each variation of column density and open these copies in a text editor to adjust the
column density value in the model:

| Parameter      | XML element                          | XML attribute           |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| column density | \c NumberColumnMaterialNormalization | \em numberColumnDensity |

Note that the SKIRT normalization occurs along the full X-axis, so the column density value must be doubled:

| Radial column density          | Value of \em numberColumnDensity |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| \f$10^{22}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$ | <tt>2e22 1/cm2</tt>              |
| \f$10^{23}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$ | <tt>2e23 1/cm2</tt>              |
| \f$10^{24}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$ | <tt>2e24 1/cm2</tt>              |
| \f$10^{25}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$ | <tt>2e25 1/cm2</tt>              |

The \c RXTORUS_CS.ski file has already been adjusted to produce the results for the narrow spectral range discussed in
\ref VanderMeulenResultsZoom.

Once all files are in place, pass the name of each ski file to SKIRT as a single command line argument. Higher number
column densities lead to longer simulation run times.
