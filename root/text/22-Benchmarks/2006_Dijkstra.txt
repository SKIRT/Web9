\page Dijkstra2006 Static Lyman-alpha sphere

\section DijkstraIntro Introduction

Inspired by the work of Neufeld 1990 for a plane-parallel slab, Dijkstra et al. 2006 present an analytical
approximation for the radiation spectrum emerging from a static, uniform neutral hydrogen sphere with a central point
source emitting at the Lyman-alpha line center. The approximation becomes more accurate for higher optical depths at
lower gas temperatures.

\section DijkstraResults SKIRT results

The figure below is copied from Camps et al. 2021. It shows the spectrum emerging from the sphere as a function of the
dimensionless frequency \f$x\f$ defined as

\f[  x = \frac{\nu - \nu_\alpha}{\nu_\alpha} \,\frac{c}{v_\mathrm{th}} \qquad \mathrm{with} \qquad
     v_\mathrm{th} = \sqrt{\frac{2 k_\mathrm{B} T}{m_\mathrm{p}}},  \f]

where \f$\nu\f$ is the regular frequency, \f$\nu_\alpha\f$ is the frequency at the Lyman-alpha line center, and
\f$v_\mathrm{th}\f$ is the thermal velocity of the neutral hydrogen gas corresponding to its temperature \f$T\f$.

The figure compares the SKIRT output (solid lines) with the analytical approximation (dotted lines) for a gas
temperature of 10 K and the three optical depth values shown by Dijkstra et al. 2006. It includes a fourth combination
with a higher gas temperature to verify that SKIRT handles other temperature values as well. It is apparent from the
figure that the numerical and analytical solutions indeed converge for higher optical depths at constant gas
temperature. Also, the discrepancies between the numerical and analytical solutions are essentially identical to those
shown by Dijkstra et al. 2006.

\section DijkstraPerform Performing this benchmark

To perform this benchmark, download the ski file provided above (\ref DijkstraRefs). Open the ski file in a text editor
to adjust the following parameter values to a particular benchmark configuration:

| Parameter        | XML element                          | XML attribute           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Gas temperature  | \c LyaNeutralHydrogenGasMix          | \em defaultTemperature  |
| Optical depth    | \c OpticalDepthMaterialNormalization | \em opticalDepth        |
| Wavelength range | \c LinWavelengthGrid | \em minWavelength and \em maxWavelength |

The benchmark specifies radial optical depth values at the Lyman-alpha line center (integrated from the origin to
infinity) while the values in the ski file normalize the line-center optical depth along the complete X-axis
(integrated from negative to positive infinity). The value in the ski file therefore must be set to twice the value
specified for the corresponding benchmark.

The wavelength range for the instrument recording the output spectrum must be adjusted to the expected spectral
dispersion for the specified temperature/optical depth combination. The appropriate values for the four combinations
shown in the figure above are:

| Gas temperature (K) | Radial optical depth | Minimum wavelength (micron) | Maximum wavelength (micron) |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 10    | 1e5 | 0.121562881 | 0.121571119 |
| 10    | 1e6 | 0.121558762 | 0.121575238 |
| 10    | 1e7 | 0.121550524 | 0.121583476 |
| 10000 | 1e7 | 0.1213846437 | 0.1217493563 |

Then pass the (name of) the ski file to SKIRT as a single command line argument. Higher optical depths and lower
temperatures lead to longer simulation run times. At the end of the simulation run, SKIRT outputs a spectrum that can
be compared to the analytical approximation.
