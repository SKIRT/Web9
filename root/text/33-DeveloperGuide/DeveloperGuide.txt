\page DeveloperGuide Developer Guide

This guide provides information on how to adjust or extend the SKIRT code and/or the Python Toolkit for SKIRT (PTS).

The SKIRT project will never be finished. Fundamental changes and additions will likely be developed in cooperation
with the SKIRT Core Team. However, you may want to adjust the code in simple ways to fit the needs of your particular
radiative transfer problem. Many features can be added without the need for an expert software development background.
We explicitly invite your open contributions to the project. A contribution can take many forms, from asking a question
to implementing a set of new classes. Information on how to contribute can be found in the \ref Contributing section of
this web site.

Before venturing into the development realm, it is obviously important to gain experience as a SKIRT user in your own
application domain. As a start, perform the tutorials and review the relevant topics provided in the \ref UserGuide. If
you plan to do substantial development, also consider the suggestions listed in \ref InstallSKIRTDev and \ref
DevGitHubFlow.
