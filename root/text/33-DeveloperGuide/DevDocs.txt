\page DevDocs Generating the SKIRT project documentation

The documentation for the SKIRT project, including this web site, is generated using the freely available utility
<a href="http://www.doxygen.nl">Doxygen</a>. For information on how to install this utility, refer to \ref
InstallSKIRTDevDoxygen.

\section DevDocsRef Reference documentation

The reference documentation is generated directly from the SKIRT C++ header files and the PTS Python source files.
When you add or adjust code, it is important to provide proper documentation in the header file, in Doxygen format. To
verify that everything looks as intended, especially when including formulas in mathematical notation, you should build
the HTML documentation and open the resulting page(s) in a web browser.

In both the SKIRT and PTS repositories, the \c git directory contains a shell script for building the documentation.
The script is designed for use on macOS and will need to be adjusted for use on other systems. For example, the
absolute path to the Doxygen executable will need to be updated, and the html.doxygen parameter file may need some
tweaking as well.

Before invoking the script for the first time, you may need to make it executable as follows:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    chmod +rx makeHTML.sh
    cd ~/PTS/git
    chmod +rx makeHTML.sh

To build the HTML reference documentation, enter:

    cd ~/SKIRT/git
    ./makeHTML.sh
    cd ~/PTS/git
    ./makeHTML.sh

The resulting HTML files are placed in the \c html directory next to (i.e. at the same level as) the \c git directory
(for SKIRT) or the \c pts directory (for PTS). As usual, the file \c index.html provides the starting point for browsing.

When you run the script for the first time, Doxygen creates the \c html directory and it contents from scratch. This
takes a long time. If you run the script again after you modified the source code (or the extra documentation files),
Doxygen only processes the changes so it completes a lot faster.


\section DevDocsExtra Additional documentation

The additional documentation made available on the SKIRT project web site, including the community section and the
installation, user and developer guides, is \em not part of the SKIRT or PTS repositories. Also authored as a set of
text files in Doxygen format (i.e. special comment blocks without actual source code), these source files are contained
in a separate public GitHub repository. This enables a fully collaborative workflow using pull requests and issues for
the documentation just as for the actual source code.

The following table lists the involved respositories in the SKIRT organization:

| Repository name | Description
|-----------------|-------------
| SKIRT9 | SKIRT 9 C++ source code
| PTS9   | Python Toolkit for SKIRT 9
| Web9   | Additional documentation for SKIRT web site

Each repository includes a \c makeHTML.sh procedure that drives Doxygen to locally build HTML pages from the comment
blocks embedded in the source code or text files in the repository. This procedure converts LaTeX formulas to images,
performing a full LaTeX syntax check along the way. As a result, this procedure enables contributors to verify changes
in the documentation before initiating a pull request (assuming Doxygen is installed on their system).

The SKIRT web site combines the documentation from the various repositories. In addition to its own makeHTML.sh
procedure, the Web9 repository therefore contains a \c stageWebsite.sh procedure to locally build the complete web site
from a local copy of all relevant repositories. This procedure uses MATHJAX to render LaTeX formulas, which avoids the
many images created by an explicit conversion, and leads to a much more pleasing formula presentation.

While any contributor can stage the web site, assuming they have a local copy of all relevant repositories, only a core
team member can actually publish the website because it requires write access rights to the web server.
