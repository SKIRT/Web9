\page DevStructPTS Overall structure of the PTS code

\section DevStructPTSDirs Directory structure

The PTS source code is contained in an online repository and can be obtained as described in the \ref InstallationGuide.
Your local copy of this repository is usually placed inside a directory called \c PTS in your home directory.
The resulting directory structure may look as follows:

    ~/PTS
        pts
            admin
                do
            band
                data
                do
            do
            docs
            simulation
            ...
            visual
                do
        run

The optional \c run directory may contain input/output files involved in actually running PTS. This information
obviously does not belong in the source code repository, which is why the \c run directory is \em not inside the \c pts
directory. The contents of the \c pts directory is an identical clone of the online PTS repository. Immediately
inside the \c pts directory resides a shell script for building the documentation (see \ref DevDocs) and a number
of subdirectories holding the source and documentation files.

\section DevStructPTSPacks Packages

A PTS \em package is represented as a top-level subdirectory of the PTS repository. PTS has no nested packages. The
following table lists the packages in PTS with an indication of their functionality.

| Package | Description
|---------|------------
| admin | Administrative functions, such as listing PTS package dependencies and creating archives for backup purposes
| band | Representing broadband filters, including transmission curve data for a set of standard bands
| simulation | Interfacing with the SKIRT executable, SKIRT parameter files, and SKIRT output files (with units)
| skiupgrade | Procedures for upgrading SKIRT parameter files to the most recent SKIRT version
| storedtable | Converting third-party data to SKIRT stored table format and otherwise accessing files in this format
| test | Performing and reporting on SKIRT functional tests
| utils | Basic utilities for use by other packages
| visual | Visualizing SKIRT results including image frames, SEDs, density cuts, temperature cuts, polarization maps, and more.

\section DevStructPTSSubdirs Other subdirectories

In addition to the package subdirectories, the following subdirectories may occur in the repository directory hierarchy
as needed:

Subdirectory | Where | Presence | Description
-------------|-------|----------|------------
\c docs | Top-level | Mandatory | Support files for building HTML pages from the comment blocks embedded in the PTS source code
\c do | Top-level | Mandatory | Implementation of the PTS command line facilities, i.e. locating and executing scripts in do subdirectories
\c do | Inside package | Optional | Command scripts that can be executed directly from the PTS command line
\c data | Inside package | Optional | Data resources required by the package containing this directory
