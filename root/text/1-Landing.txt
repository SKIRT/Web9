\section LandingIntro Introduction

Welcome!

The SKIRT project offers state-of-the-art software for simulating radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems
such as galaxies, accretion disks, or star forming regions. At the project's heart is the C++ SKIRT code, which
employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and
emission by the transfer medium. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries, radiation sources, dust
characterizations, spatial grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for importing models generated by
hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined in a parameter file that can be
constructed through a user-friendly command-line Q&A session, or with an optional graphical interface.

Another optional component of the SKIRT project is the "Python Toolkit for SKIRT", or PTS. The Python code in this
toolkit can help prepare, postprocess, and visualize SKIRT-related data, or it can execute SKIRT simulations in
automated contexts.

The SKIRT project is fully open source, including all C++ and Python code and the contents of this web site, and
publicly available under liberal licensing conditions (see \ref LegalInfo). We invite you to use the SKIRT project's
software for your work, and to interact with other users and/or contribute to the project (see \ref Contributing).
Results of applying SKIRT to various astrophysical models have been reported in over 80 refereed publications so far
(see \ref PublicationsAllDate "Publications").

\section LandingVersions Project versions

This web site includes documentation for two versions of the SKIRT project. Version 9 is the current stable version and
is recommended for any new projects. SKIRT 9 has been designed to allow a wider range of physics than previous
versions. For example, it already implements kinematics, and the long-term goal is to include extra dust physics (e.g.,
polarization caused by aligned spheroidal dust grains) and other transfer media (e.g., some aspects of hydrogen line
transfer). The code has been extensively tested, runs all available benchmarks, and is actively used for various
science projects. It is fully documented, including tutorials, concept notes and reference material. PTS 9 is the
corresponding new version of the Python toolkit for SKIRT.

Version 8 of the SKIRT project is now outdated; its documentation is provided here for legacy reasons.

\section LandingNavigating Navigating this web site

You can navigate the SKIRT project web site by clicking the tabs in the bar at the top of each page. The three leftmost
tabs allow you to come back to this home page and to select the respective entry pages for project versions 8 or 9.
The other tabs adjust depending on where you are in the web site.

At the top level you'll find pages common to the complete project, including legal and contact information, guidelines
for contributing to the project, and a list of related publications. At the first level down, for each version of the
SKIRT project, you'll find pages with introductory material, tutorials, benchmark information, download links, and
access points to more in-depth information on each of SKIRT and PTS. This in-depth documentation resides at the deepest
level of the web site, offering an installation guide, a user guide, a developer guide, and full reference material
for each project component and version.
