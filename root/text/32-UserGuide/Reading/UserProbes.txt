\section UserProbesTypes Types of probes

Generally speaking, SKIRT generates two types of output from a simulation: instruments produce synthetic observations
of the simulated model, while probes sample numerical or physical quantities internal to the simulated model. Probes
thus provide relevant diagnostics on the simulation setup and offer an opportunity to investigate properties of the
simulated model that could never be directly observed from the outside, such as for example the radiation field.

A simulation can be configured with any number of probes and can include multiple probes of the same type. This can be
useful to probe the same quantity in various ways, perhaps at different positions or wavelengths or at different stages
during the simulation. In fact, SKIRT includes dozens of probe types and many of those have several user options that
determine the precise operation of the probe.

A probe is an instance of one of the Probe subclasses. At the highest level, the Probe class hierarchy is split in
three categories as illustrated in the diagram below.

        SpecialtyProbe [label="SpecialtyProbe" URL="\ref SpecialtyProbe"];

        InputModelFormProbe -> Probe;
        SpatialGridFormProbe -> Probe;
        SpecialtyProbe -> Probe;
}
\enddot

The input model probes (InputModelFormProbe subclasses) probe quantities defined by the input model, provided the
relevant data is retained in memory by the simulation. Examples include the luminosity of primary sources and the mass
density distribution of media. In the current implementation, these probes work only for imported sources and media.
Because they operate directly on the original, imported data structures, there are no re-gridding effects in the output
generated by these probes.

The internal spatial grid probes (SpatialGridFormProbe subclasses) probe quantities discretized over the spatial grid
that is used in the simulation to perform radiative transfer. This includes quantities directly derived from the input
model and re-gridded to the internal grid during setup, such as the mass density, and quantities calculated during the
simulation, such as the radiation field. These probes work regardless of whether the input model was imported or
defined using built-in geometries.

The third category contains specialty probes (SpecialtyProbe subclasses) that do not fit in another category for one
reason or another. This includes probes tracking numerical aspects of the simulation, such as the number of photon
packets being launched, or probes that output statistics on the quality of the internal spatial grid.


\section UserProbesForms Forms

The probes in the first two categories (input model and internal grid) all share a common mechanism to define how a
given quantity must be probed. The goal is to allow combining two orthogonal concepts in an arbitrary fashion. The
quantity being probed is specified by the probe (a Probe subclass), while the manner in which this quantity is being
probed is specified by a \em form (a Form subclass). The table below lists the available Form subclasses; for more
information refer to the respective class documentation.

| %Form subclass | Output|
| --- | --- |
| PlanarCutsForm | FITS file with cut along a specified plane parallel to one of the coordinate planes |
| ParallelProjectionForm | FITS file with %Parallel projection towards a specified sight line (inclination, azimuth) |
| AllSkyProjectionForm | FITS file with all-sky projection towards a specified position, usually inside the model |
| LinearCutForm | Column text file with rows for positions along a specified line segment |
| MeridionalCutForm | Column text file with rows for positions along a specified meridional arc |
| AtPositionsForm | Column text file with row for each position listed in an input file |
| | <em>Only applicable to internal spatial grid probes:</em>
| DefaultCutsForm | FITS files with default cuts along the coordinate planes |
| PerCellForm | Column text file with row for each internal grid cell |

For input model and internal grid probes, each probe must thus be configured with an associated form. By associating
multiple probes of the same type with a form with different properties or a different type of form, one can easily
probe a given quantity (e.g., dust mass density) in various ways (e.g., cuts along different planes or projections from
different sight lines).

Most of the forms can be associated with any probe types, except that some forms do not work with the input model
probes because they require the internal spatial grid. This includes the PerCellForm, for obvious reasons, and the
DefaultCutsForm, because it requires the extent of the simulation's spatial grid.


\section UserProbesInput Input model probes

The table below lists the available input model probes.

| %Probe subclass | \# values | Aggregation | %Configuration options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Sources_ | | | |
| ImportedSourceLuminosityProbe | \f$N_\lambda\f$ | %System | _wavelengthGrid_, _convolve_|
| ImportedSourceDensityProbe | 1 | %System | _massType_ |
| ImportedSourceMetallicityProbe | 1 | %System | _weight_, _wavelength_ |
| ImportedSourceAgeProbe | 1 | %System | _weight_, _wavelength_ |
| ImportedSourceVelocityProbe | 3 | %System | _weight_, _wavelength_ |
| _Media_ | | | |
| ImportedMediumDensityProbe | 1 | Component | |
| ImportedMediumMetallicityProbe | 1 | Component | |
| ImportedMediumTemperatureProbe | 1 | Component | |
| ImportedMediumVelocityProbe | 3 | Component | |

The second column lists the number of values for each quantity sample. The luminosity probe outputs a value for each
bin in the specified wavelength grid; other than that, scalar quantities have a single value and vector quantities have
three values, one for each vector component.

The third column lists the aggregation mechanism. The source probes combine information from all sources in the
simulation. Therefore, they work only if all sources in the model are imported \em and offer the required properties.
For example, the metallicity probe requires all sources to be imported and include a metallicity column as part of the
parameters for the associated %SED family. In contrast, the medium probes produce separate output for each individual
medium component. They simply skip any components that are not imported or do not offer the required properties.

The last column lists the options to configure these probes, other than the probe name and the form associated with the
probe.

The luminosity probe obviously requires a wavelength grid (for more information on wavelength grids, see \ref
UserWaveGrids). If the \em convolve option is false, the specific luminosity is sampled at the characteristic
wavelength of each bin. If the \em convolve property is true, the specific luminosity is averaged over the width of
each wavelength bin (for disjoint wavelength grids) or convolved over each broadband transmission curve (for band
wavelength bins). When associated with a ParallelProjectionForm, this probe can thus produce transparent noise-free
narrowband or broadband images of the imported sources.

The source density probe outputs the initial or current mass density accumulated over all imported sources. Most
single-stellar-population (SSP) %SED families require the initial mass of the stellar population as an import
parameter. On the other hand, stellar mass maps should be based on the current population mass. Therefore, this probe
offers the \em massType option. When set to \c InitialMass, the probe will use the initial mass as a suboptimal
solution. However, assuming that the current mass can be obtained when preparing SKIRT's input data, a better solution
is to provide it as a separate, additional column to the import process, enable the \em importCurrentMass option for
the ImportedSource component(s), and set the \em massType option for the probe to \c CurrentMass. Now the probe will
use the separately imported current mass.

The source metallicity, age and velocity probes handle averaged quantities as it is not meaningful to accumulate them
over multiple sources. The \em weight option determines how the quantity is averaged: using the \c InitialMass, using
the \c CurrentMass (see previous paragraph), or using the specific \c Luminosity at the wavelength specified in the
\em wavelength option.

The medium probes do not need any of these options because the quantities being handled do not depend on wavelength and
components are handled indvidually. There is, however, a caveat with respect to the averaging scheme for dust media
represented as particles. See the documentation of the respective classes.

Input model probes are always executed at the end of the simulation setup phase. There is no reason to delay this any
further because the quantities being handled never change during the simulation.
