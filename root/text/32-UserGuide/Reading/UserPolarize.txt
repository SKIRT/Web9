\page UserPolarize Simulating polarized radiation

This topic should explain how to configure SKIRT for polarization.
(primary emission, scattering by spherical grains, emission by aligned spheroidal grains)

To actually enable polarization support in a SKIRT simulation:
  - Ensure that all configured material mixes support polarization and have polarization enabled;
    see e.g. the MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition, PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition,
    ElectronMix, and LyaNeutralHydrogenGasMix classes.
  - Configure instruments to record polarization characteristics, i.e. Stokes vector elements;
    see the Instrument class.
