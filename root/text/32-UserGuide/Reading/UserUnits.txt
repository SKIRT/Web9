\page UserUnits The SKIRT units system

\section UserUnitsIntro Introduction

SKIRT supports a rich set of astronomical units for input and output purposes. Internally, however, SKIRT uses the
International System of Units (SI) for all physical quantities. Furthermore, all spectral quantities are internally
expressed in wavelength style, i.e. wavelength (m) or per wavelength (1/m). The conversion from input units to SI units
occurs at input time, and the conversion from SI units to output units occurs at output time. In other words, the unit
conversion code is isolated in specific input and output modules. This convention allows all other code to avoid unit
conversions, thus simplifying any internal calculations.

\section UserUnitsSystems Unit systems

To configure the input/output units employed for a simulation, the user selects a \em unit \em system (SI units,
stellar units, or extra-galactic units) and selects an \em output \em style (wavelengths, frequency, or energy) for
spectral "wavelength" and "flux" quantities. For example, selecting

    <SIUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Wavelength" fluxOutputStyle="Wavelength"/>

would output all quantities in internal form without conversion, e.g., distance, and wavelength in m and surface
brightness in W/m3/sr. On the other hand, a simulation of a galaxy in the optical-FIR spectral range may instead
specify

    <ExtragalacticUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Wavelength" fluxOutputStyle="Frequency"/>

which would output distance in Mpc, wavelength in micron, and surface brightness in MJy/sr. As a final exanple, a
simulation of a circumstellar system in the X-ray spectral range may specify

    <StellarUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Energy" fluxOutputStyle="Energy"/>

which would output distance in pc, wavelength in keV, and surface brightness in 1/s/cm2/keV/arcsec2.

On the input side (in ski files, in interactive question and answer mode, and in import file column headers) units
can usually be mixed regardless of the selected unit system and output styles. For example, a "wavelength" can be
expressed as a wavelength (e.g. in Angstrom), a frequency (e.g. in THz) or in energy units (e.g. in MeV) at the user's
choice.


\section UserUnitsSupport Supported units

In ski files, in interactive question and answer mode, and in import file column headers, SKIRT recognizes various
unit abbreviations for each type of physical quantity. The supported abbreviations are listed in the following table.
Unit abbreviations of the form "1/xxx" can also be written without the leading "1". For example, "17 /cm" is equivalent
to "17 1/cm". In all cases, remember to include a space between the number and the unit abbreviation.
