\page UserUnits The SKIRT units system & supported units

\section UserUnitsIntro Introduction

SKIRT supports a rich set of astronomical units for input and output purposes. Internally, however, SKIRT uses the
International System of Units (SI) for all physical quantities. Furthermore, all spectral quantities are internally
expressed in wavelength style, i.e. wavelength (m) or per wavelength (1/m). The conversion from input units to SI units
occurs at input time, and the conversion from SI units to output units occurs at output time. In other words, the unit
conversion code is isolated in specific input and output modules. This convention allows all other code to avoid unit
conversions, thus simplifying the internal calculations.


\section UserUnitsSystems Unit system configuration

To configure the default units employed for a simulation, the user first selects the UnitSystem subclass:

- SI units: standard international units, i.e. m as the unit of length, distance, and wavelength, and kg as the unit
  of mass.
- Stellar units: use AU as the unit of length, pc as the unit of distance, \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$ as the unit of
  wavelength, and \f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\f$ as the unit of mass.
- Extragalactic units: use pc as the unit of length, Mpc as the unit of distance, \f$\mu\mathrm{m}\f$ as the unit of
  wavelength, and \f$\mathrm{M}_\odot\f$ as the unit of mass.

The UnitSystem class has two properties to then select the flavor of spectral quantities:

- \c wavelengthOutputStyle: the output style of the spectral variable; i.e. photon \c Wavelength, photon \c Frequency,
  or photon \c Energy.
- \c fluxOutputStyle: the output style of flux-related values such as spatially integrated flux density or surface
  brightness; i.e. \c Neutral (\f$\lambda F_\lambda=\nu F_\nu\f$), per unit of \c Wavelength (\f$F_\lambda\f$),
  per unit of \c Frequency (\f$F_\nu\f$) or counts per unit of \c Energy (\f$F_\mathrm{E}\f$).

For example, selecting

    <SIUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Wavelength" fluxOutputStyle="Wavelength"/>

would output all quantities in internal form without conversion, e.g., distance and wavelength in \c m and surface
brightness in \c W/m3/sr. On the other hand, a simulation of a galaxy in the optical-FIR spectral range may instead
specify

    <ExtragalacticUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Wavelength" fluxOutputStyle="Frequency"/>

which would output distance in \c Mpc, wavelength in \c micron, and surface brightness in \c MJy/sr. As a final
example, a simulation of a circumstellar system in the X-ray spectral range may specify

    <StellarUnits wavelengthOutputStyle="Energy" fluxOutputStyle="Energy"/>

which would output distance in \c pc, wavelength in \c keV, and surface brightness in \c 1/s/cm2/keV/arcsec2.


\section UserUnitsUsage Units for input and output

The unit system configuration in the SKIRT parameter file (/em ski file) determines the default units used for the
simulation. The input/output modules handle units as follows:

- All output files produced by the simulation use the configured default units. This includes the files produced by
  instruments and probes, the generated copy of the parameter file (\c _parameters.xml) and the log file (\c _log.txt).

- In responses to the Q&A for configuring the ski file (in the terminal or in MakeUp), and for values in the ski file
  itself, one can use any of the \ref UserUnitsSupport "units supported" for the quantity under consideration.

- In text column input files (e.g. defining an %SED or listing source particles extracted from a hydrodynamical
  simulation), the structured column headers (see TextInFile) can specify any of the
  \ref UserUnitsSupport "units supported" for the quantity under consideration. If no headers are provided, the assumed
  units are determined by the class reading the input file, as described in the class documentation. In this case, the
  default units configured in the ski file are \em not used.

On the input side, different spectral flavors can usually be specified. For example, a "wavelength" can be
expressed as a wavelength (e.g. in \c Angstrom), a frequency (e.g. in \c THz) or in energy units (e.g. in \c
MeV). Similarly, a luminosity density can be expressed as a per wavelength (e.g. \c Lsun/micron), per frequency
(e.g. \c erg/s/Hz) or per energy quantity (e.g. \c /s/keV).


\section UserUnitsSupport Supported units

In ski files, in interactive Q&A mode, and in input file column headers, SKIRT recognizes various unit abbreviations
for each type of physical quantity. The supported abbreviations are listed in the following table. Unit abbreviations
of the form "1/xxx" can also be written without the leading "1". For example, "17 /cm" is equivalent to "17 1/cm". In
all cases, remember to include a space between the number and the unit abbreviation.
