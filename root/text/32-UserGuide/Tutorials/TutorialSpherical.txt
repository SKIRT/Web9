\page TutorialSpherical Constructing a quasar model in spherical coordinates

In this tutorial, you study the polarization characteristics of the UV emission from a typical quasar using a SKIRT
model that benefits from being simulated in spherical coordinates. Although you can download all ingredients to perform
the simulations being discussed, the text is perhaps conceived more as a case study than as a detailed tutorial.

Along the way, you will:
 - construct a nontrivial model that uses the library of geometries and dust mixtures built into SKIRT.
 - use a geometry decorator to adjust the model.
 - configure a spatial grid (for radiative transfer) using spherical coordinates.
 - discover the important benefits of 2D and 3D spherical grids for the type of models under consideration.


\section TutorialSphericalBegin Getting ready

This text below assumes that you have completed the introductory SKIRT tutorials \ref TutorialBasicsMono and \ref
TutorialBasicsPan, and that you have reviewed the topic on and \ref UserSpatialGrids, or that you have otherwise
acquired the working knowledge introduced there.

While you do not necessarily need to run any SKIRT simulations to follow along with this tutorial/case study, it
certainly is instructive to review the ski files being discussed. Thus, begin by downloading the ski files using the
links provided in the table below.

If you do want to perform the simulations on your system. pehaps in slightly modified form, then you should obviously
have installed the SKIRT code, and preferably also PTS and a FITS file viewer such as DS9 (see \ref InstallationGuide).
