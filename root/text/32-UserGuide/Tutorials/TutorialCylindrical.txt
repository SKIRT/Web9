\page TutorialCylindrical Importing a cylindrical 2D snapshot

In this tutorial you are faced with a snapshot exported from a 2D hydrodynamical model. The model is defined in the
meridional plane using cylindrical coordinates. The snapshot provides both density and velocity distributions. Assuming
a central point source, the goal is to investigate the effect of the kinematics on the observed spectrum at various
inclinations.

Along the way, you will:
 - prepare raw data for import into SKIRT,
 - configure a SKIRT simulation for importing 2D cylindrical data,
 - configure a cylindrical grid appropriate for the imported data,
 - provide support for kinematics (i.e. bulk velocities),
 - plot and interpret some of the simulation results.


\section TutorialCylindricalPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory SKIRT tutorials \ref TutorialBasicsMono and \ref
TutorialBasicsPan, and that you have reviewed the topics on \ref UserImportSnap, \ref UserImportColOrder, and \ref
UserSpatialGrids, or that you have otherwise acquired the working knowledge introduced there. At the very least, before
starting this tutorial, you should have installed the SKIRT code, and preferably also PTS and a FITS file viewer such
as DS9 (see \ref InstallationGuide).

Begin by downloading the raw data used in this tutorial, i.e. the file \c TutorialCylindricalRawData.txt, using the
first link provided in the table below. If you want (or need) to skip the data preparation step, you can also download
the file \c TutorialCylindricalImportReady.txt using the second link provided in the table below.
