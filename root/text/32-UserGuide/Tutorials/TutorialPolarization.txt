\page TutorialPolarization Dust scattering polarization signatures of spiral galaxies

In this tutorial you will work with a basic spiral galaxy model that includes the effects of polarization caused by the
scattering of stellar radiation by spherical dust grains. You will discover a signature of the spiral arms in the
polarization degree of the observed radiation, at least for this simplified model.

\section TutorialPolarizationPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory SKIRT tutorials \ref TutorialBasicsMono ad \ref
TutorialBasicsPan, or that you have otherwise acquired the working knowlegde introduced there. At the very least,
before starting this tutorial, you should have installed the SKIRT code, and preferably also PTS and a FITS file viewer
such as DS9 (see \ref InstallationGuide).

The polarization state of electromagnetic radiation is commonly described by the Stokes vector, the linear polarization
degree and the polarization angle. For a brief recap of these concepts, see \ref UserPolarize. For a more extensive
background and a description of the implementation of polarization in SKIRT, refer to \ref DevPolarize in the developer
guide.

To avoid spending time creating yet another SKIRT parameter file from scratch, this tutorial offers a \em ski file for
download to serve as an initial configuration. Download the file \c TutorialPolarizationSpiral.ski using the link
provided in the table below and put it into your local working directory.

\section TutorialPolarizationInitial The initial configuration

Rename the downloaded SKIRT parameter file to a shorter name of your liking ending with the ".ski" filename extension,
for example \c Spiral.ski. Run this \em ski file with SKIRT. If SKIRT immediately produces a fatal error while
constructing the simulation, this probably means that the \em ski file needs upgrading; see \ref UserUpgradeSki.

While the simulation is running, open the \em ski file in a text editor and examine its contents. You should recognize
the following configuration elements (not in this order):

 - an oligochromatic simulation with three wavelengths, using a few million photon packets in total
 - a spatial geometry with four components:
     - a flattened Sérsic bulge consisting of evolved stars (3500 K)
     - a thicker exponential disk consisting of evolved stars (3500 K), with spiral arm structure
     - a thinner exponential disk consisting of young stars (10000 K), with spiral arm structure
     - an exponential dust disk with spiral arm structure (the arms in the young stellar disk and the dust disk trail
       those in the evolved stellar population by varying the phase zero-points)
 - a material mix called \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, representing the dust properties used in the Gordon et. al 2017
   benchmark (see \ref Gordon2017)
 - an adaptive octree grid
 - six instruments at various inclination and azimuth angles

After the SKIRT simulation completes, examine its output. View the surface brightness frames generated by the
instruments at various inclinations and wavelengths until you are satisfied that the results are as expected.

\section TutorialPolarizationEnable Enabling polarization

Enabling polarization in this configuration is straightforward. Duplicate the \em ski file and rename the copy,
for example to \c PolarSpiral.ski. Open the new file in your text editor and make the following adjustments:
 - on the line listing the material mix used in the configuration, i.e. \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, change the value
   of the \c scatteringType option from "HenyeyGreenstein" to "SphericalPolarization";
 - for each of the six instruments, change the value of the \c recordPolarization option from "false" to "true".

Save these changes and run the updated \em ski file with SKIRT. Continue reading while the simulation is running.

As indicated in the introduction, SKIRT supports polarization of radiation by scattering on spherical dust grains. This
feature is automatically enabled if the material mixture(s) in the configuration offer the appropriate optical
properties (i.e., essentially, the Müller matrix that describes the changes to the Stokes vector during a scattering
event). In that case, the radiation's polarization properties are tracked as photon packets move through the medium,
and the instruments can be requested to record the components of the Stokes vector for detected photon packets,
accumulated in each pixel/wavelength bin.

The \c MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix class implements the relevant properties for a "representative grain" of the complete
grain population, i.e. integrated over the size distribution and summed over material types. This is fine for a
treatment of scattering in the optical range (as in this tutorial), but when including dust emission the calculation
requires specific information for multiple grain size bins. See \ref UserPolarize for configuration options in this
respect.


\section TutorialPolarizationVisual Visualizing the results

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualFITS Using a FITS viewer

After the SKIRT simulation with polarization support completes, examine the output directory. For each instrument,
there now are three extra FITS files containing the Stokes Q, U, and V components, in addition to the "totals" file
containing the intensity (i.e. the Stokes I component).

Open the Q and U components for an instrument with face-on inclination in a FITS file viewer, and open an inspector
showing a histogram of the pixel values (DS9->Scale->Parameters). In contrast to the intensity, the other Stokes
components can have negative values. To enhance visualization of the spatial structure, you may need to play with the
color bar scheme, scale and range. It might help to clip the values at zero (i.e. only showing positive values) to
avoid problems with typical color scales such as the log scale.

Compare the 2D structure of the Q and U components. Examine the differences as you browse through the wavelengths.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualMaps Polarization maps with PTS

While the Stokes components correspond to the output of an actual observation, it is much easier to interprete
quantities such as the polarization degree and angle, which can be calculated from the Stokes vector components
(see \ref UserPolarizeBackground).

Using PTS, you can easily produce plots of polarization degree and angle for the output of a SKIRT simulation. To
generate a default polarization map per instrument and per wavelength, simply enter (with the SKIRT output directory as
the current directory):

\verbatim
pts plot_polarization . --bin=20
\endverbatim

The \c bin argument specifies the number of image frame pixels (in each spatial direction) to be combined in a single
"polarization" bin. Because of the limited number of photon packets launched for this tutorial, the output is fairly
noisy, and it is best to specify fairly large bins (e.g. 20 by 20 pixels). If you rerun the simulation with
substantially more photon packets, you might get acceptable plots with a reduced bin size.

This produces plots like these:

\image html TutorialPolarizationMapFace.png
\image html TutorialPolarizationMapEdge.png

These figures show surface brightness maps (color scale) overlaid with linear polarization maps (line segments) for the
spiral galaxy model of this tutorial, observed at a wavelength of \f$1 \mu\mathrm{m}\f$. The orientation of the line
segments indicates the polarization angle, and the size of the line segments indicates the degree of linear
polarization. The top figure shows the model face-on, and the bottom figure shows the model edge-on.

The polarization degree is up to 1\% around the central part of the model. In the face-on view, the orientation of the
polarization is circular around the central bulge, showing a clear spiral structure. In the edge-on view, the
polarization degree shows maxima at two positions to the left and two positions to the right of the center. When
comparing with the face-on view, it appears that these positions correspond to the edge-on projection of the spiral arm
structure.

\subsection TutorialPolarizationVisualCurves Average polarization degree plots with PTS

The \c pts \c plot_polarization command can also generate other types of plots. For example, to plot the linear
polarization degree averaged over the Y-axis per instrument and per wavelength, enter:

\verbatim
pts plot_polarization . --plot=degavg
\endverbatim

The result is obtained by averaging each individual component of the Stokes vector over the Y-axis at each X position,
and calculating the polarization degree from these totals. This produces plots like this one:

\image html TutorialPolarizationCurve.png

This average polarization degree plot corresponds to the edge-on polarization map shown above (i.e. they are for the
same inclination and wavelength). Even if the two plots unfortunately do not have the same horizontal size, it is
easily verified that the polarization degree maxima indeed occur at the same X-axis positions.

The model confguration for this tutorial includes a second set of instruments with lines of sight at the same
inclinations but with a different azimuthal angle, resulting in a "rotated" view. The figure below shows adjacent
results for the original view (left column) and for the rotated view (right column). This figure was produced by
a custom Python script and is based on a simulation using many more photon packets (see Peest et al. 2017).

\image html TutorialPolarizationGrid.png

From this figure it is clear that regions with higher linear polarization trace the spiral arms at all inclinations,
including the edge-on view. The maxima in the polarization signature of the edge-on view match the positions of the
spiral arms along the line of sight. Indeed, the peaks in the polarization signature align with the tangent points of
the spiral arms, which for the rotated view (right column) are farther out from the center of the galaxy.

These results imply that polarization measurements could be used, at least in principle, to study the spiral structure
of edge-on spiral galaxies, where intensity measurements alone have limited diagnostic power.
