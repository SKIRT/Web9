\page TutorialXRayTorus X-ray reprocessing in a clumpy AGN torus

This tutorial introduces the X-ray capabilities of the SKIRT code. You will study X-ray reprocessing in an obscured
active galactic nucleus (AGN), represented by cold gas in a parsec-scale torus surrounding a central source. The goal
is to produce X-ray SEDs in the 0.3 to 150 keV range, showing reflection from a clumpy wedge torus geometry. You will
create a ski file containing the appropriate simulation parameters, perform the SKIRT simulation, and review the
simulation results focusing on the X-ray reflection spectra.


\section TutorialXRayTorusPre Getting ready

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the introductory SKIRT tutorial \ref TutorialBasicsMono, or that you have
otherwise acquired the working knowledge introduced there. At the very least, before starting this tutorial, you should
have installed the SKIRT code, and preferably also PTS and a FITS file viewer such as DS9 (see \ref InstallationGuide).

To complete this tutorial, you will need a tabulated spectrum for the primary X-ray source. In an actual research
setting, you would probably consider an exponentially cut-off power law. For this tutorial, you can assume a
straightforward power law spectrum with a negative power law index of 1.8. Such a tabulated %SED can easily be created
using the following Python script:

\code{.py}
import numpy as np
E = np.logspace(-1, 3, 10000)       # 0.1 to 1000 keV
F = E**(-1.8)                       # Power-law SED
header = "Column 1: wavelength (keV)\nColumn 2: specific luminosity (1/s/keV)"
np.savetxt("PowerLawSED.txt", np.array([E,F]).T, header=header)
\endcode

The text file produced by this script includes important header comment lines starting with "# Column":

\verbatim
# Column 1: wavelength (keV)
# Column 2: specific luminosity (1/s/keV)
1.000000000000000056e-01 6.309573444801932851e+01
...
\endverbatim

SKIRT parses these header comment lines and recognizes the physical quantities and the corresponding units (specified
between parentheses) for the values listed in each column of the text file. Omitting these header lines would lead
SKIRT to assume default units, which in this case would not yield the desired spectrum.

As an alternative to running the above Python script, you can download the file \c PowerLawSED.txt using the link
provided in the table below and put it into your local working directory.

\section TutorialXRayTorusSki Creating the ski file

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusStart Starting the SKIRT Q&A

In a terminal window, with your local working directory as the current directory, start SKIRT without any command line
arguments. SKIRT responds with a welcome message and starts an interactive session in the terminal window, during
which it will prompt you for all the information describing the simulation:

\verbatim
   Welcome to SKIRT v___
   Running on ___ for ___
   Interactively constructing a simulation...
 ? Enter the name of the ski file to be created: ClumpyTorus
\endverbatim

The first question is for the filename of the \em ski file. For this tutorial, enter "ClumpyTorus".

In this tutorial, we skip the questions for which there is only one possible answer. The answers to these questions are
provided without prompting the user, and listing them here would bring no added value.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusLev Experience level

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the user experience level:
      1. Basic: for beginning users (hides many options)
      2. Regular: for regular users (hides esoteric options)
      3. Expert: for expert users (hides no options)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (2): 1
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoLev), the Q&A session can be tailored to the experience
level of the user. For this tutorial, select the \em Basic level.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusUni Units

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the units system:
      1. SI units
      2. Stellar units (length in AU, distance in pc)
      3. Extragalactic units (length in pc, distance in Mpc)
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3): 3
   Possible choices for the output style for wavelengths:
      1. As photon wavelength: λ
      2. As photon frequency: ν
      3. As photon energy: E
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 3
   Possible choices for the output style for flux density and surface brightness:
      1. Neutral: λ F_λ = ν F_ν
      2. Per unit of wavelength: F_λ
      3. Per unit of frequency: F_ν
      4. Counts per unit of energy: F_E
  ? Enter one of these numbers [1,4] (3): 4
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoUni), SKIRT offers several options for the
output units. In this tutorial, you will be modelling an AGN, so select extragalactic units (the default option). In
the X-ray range, you want to use photon energies in keV as the spectral variable, and photon counts per energy as the
flux output style. The spatially integrated flux densities in output SEDs will then be expressed in standard X-ray
units (\f$\mathrm{counts}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{keV}^{-1}\f$).

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusSim Simulation mode

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the overall simulation mode:
      1. No medium - oligochromatic regime (a few discrete wavelengths)
      2. Extinction only - oligochromatic regime (a few discrete wavelengths)
      3. No medium (primary sources only)
      4. Extinction only (no secondary emission)
      ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,8] (4): 4
\endverbatim

As discussed in a previous tutorial (see \ref TutorialBasicsMonoSim), the answer to this question determines the
wavelength regime of the simulation (oligochromatic or panchromatic) and sets the overall scheme for handling media in
the simulation.

All X-ray physics in SKIRT are implemented in "Extinction only" mode, including the X-ray reprocessing that is the
focus of this tutorial. Furthermore, as X-ray interactions modify the photon energy, oligochromatic simulations are not
very useful in the X-ray range, and therefore you should always select option "Extinction only (no secondary emission)"
when configuring X-ray simulations.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusPho Photon packets

\verbatim
 ? Enter the default number of photon packets launched per simulation segment [0,1e19] (1e6): 5e6
\endverbatim

X-ray simulations run faster than simulations including dust extinction and emission, and therefore you can set the
number of photon packets to \f$5\times 10^6\f$ for this tutorial rather than the default value of \f$10^6\f$. Further
increasing this number will produce SEDs with an even higher signal to noise ratio.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusSrc Source system

\verbatim
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of photon packets launched from primary sources ...: 500 keV
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of photon packets launched from primary sources ...: 0.3 keV
\endverbatim

For panchromatic simulations, the source system requests the limits of the wavelength range to be considered for the
primary sources. Keep in mind that the shortest wavelength corresponds to the highest photon energy, and vice versa. In
this tutorial, you are interested in X-ray SEDs in the 0.3 to 150 keV range. However, as X-ray interactions in cold
material reduce the photon energy, you also have to consider radiative transfer at higher photon energies. The exact
energy range depends on the highest observed energy (higher energy photons experience stronger downshifts) and on the
column density of the medium (more interactions cause more consecutive downshifts). For this tutorial, you can select a
shortest wavelength of 500 keV, and a longest wavelength of 0.3 keV.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for item #1 in the primary sources list:
      1. A primary point source
      2. A primary source with a built-in geometry
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,6] (2): 1
 ? Enter the position of the point source, x component ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[ (0 pc):
 ? Enter the position of the point source, y component ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[ (0 pc):
 ? Enter the position of the point source, z component ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[ (0 pc):
\endverbatim

The source of primary X-ray photons (i.e. the X-ray corona of the AGN) can be modelled as a point source at the origin
(the default position coordinate values).

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the spectral energy distribution for the source:
      1. A black-body spectral energy distribution
         ...
     11. A spectral energy distribution loaded from a text file
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,11] (1): 11
 ? Enter the name of the file with the spectral energy distribution: PowerLawSED.txt
\endverbatim

Configure the spectrum for the X-ray corona to be loaded from the text file named \c PowerLawSED.txt you created or
downloaded earlier.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the type of luminosity normalization for the source:
      1. Source normalization through the integrated luminosity for a given wavelength range
      2. Source normalization through the specific luminosity at a given wavelength
      3. Source normalization through the specific luminosity for a given wavelength band
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 1
   Possible choices for the wavelength range for which to provide the integrated luminosity:
      1. The wavelength range of the primary sources
      2. All wavelengths (i.e. over the full SED)
      3. A custom wavelength range specified here
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (1): 3
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength of the integration range ...: 10 keV
 ? Enter the longest wavelength of the integration range ...: 2 keV
 ? Enter the integrated luminosity for the given wavelength range ]0 erg/s,∞ erg/s[: 4e42 erg/s
\endverbatim

The X-ray luminosity of AGN is commonly expressed through the integrated luminosity in the 2 to 10 keV range. Select
the option to normalise the %SED through the integrated luminosity for a given wavelength range, choose a custom
wavelength range, and specify the shortest (10 keV) and longest (2 keV) wavelengths. Finally,  provide a
typical AGN luminosity of \f$4\times10^{42}~\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\f$.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for item #2 in the primary sources list:
      1. A primary point source
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,6] (2): 0
\endverbatim

When asked for a second source component, enter zero to terminate the list.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusMed Medium system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for item #1 in the transfer media list:
      1. A transfer medium with a built-in geometry
      2. A transfer medium imported from smoothed particle data
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,5] (1): 1
   Possible choices for the geometry of the spatial density distribution for the medium:
      1. A Plummer geometry
         ...
     21. A decorator that adds spiral structure to any axisymmetric geometry
     22. A decorator that adds clumpiness to any geometry
     23. A decorator that combines two different geometries
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,23] (1): 22
   Possible choices for the geometry to be made clumpy:
      1. A Plummer geometry
         ...
      8. A ring geometry
      9. A torus geometry
     10. A donut torus geometry
     11. An annulus geometry
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,23] (1): 9
 ? Enter the radial powerlaw exponent p of the torus [0,∞[: 0
 ? Enter the polar index q of the torus [0,∞[: 0
 ? Enter the half opening angle of the torus [0 deg,90 deg]: 30
 ? Enter the minimum radius of the torus ]0 pc,∞ pc[: 1.5
 ? Enter the maximum radius of the torus ]0 pc,∞ pc[: 15
 ? Enter the fraction of the mass locked up in clumps [0,1]: 0.5
 ? Enter the total number of clumps [1,2000000000]: 1000
 ? Enter the scale radius of a single clump ]0 pc,∞ pc[: 0.5
\endverbatim

You now introduce the parsec-scale clumpy torus of cold gas to the simulation. A given base geometry (here: the torus)
can be modified through a decorator (here: clumpiness), and the decorator must be specified before the base geometry.
Select a transfer medium with a built-in geometry (the default option), and choose the clumpiness decorator. Then,
select a plain (wedge) torus base geometry, and configure a uniform density (i.e. with radial and polar exponents equal
to zero) and an opening angle of 30 degrees (measured from the equatorial plane), extending from 1.5 pc to 15 pc.
Finally, specify that half of the torus material is locked up in 1000 clumps of 0.5 pc radius. The clumps will be
randomly distributed over the torus base geometry.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the material type and properties throughout the medium:
      1. A typical interstellar dust mix (mean properties)
         ...
      7. A population of electrons
         ...
     10. A gas mix supporting photo-absorption and fluorescence for X-ray wavelengths
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,11] (1): 10
\endverbatim

Next, you specify the composition of the medium contained in the clumpy torus. Select the gas mix that implements X-ray
processes. As this is the only SKIRT material type with support for X-ray processes, you should always select it when
configuring X-ray simulations. This material mix supports photo-absorption, fluorescence and bound-electron scattering
by cold neutral gas (H to Zn), and requires no further configuration at experience level \em Basic. At higher
experience levels, you can configure custom gas mixes by specifying the abundance of each element, or choose to
approximate bound-electron scattering by free-electron scattering. For more information on configuring this material
type, see the XRayAtomicGasMix class documentation. In any case, keep in mind that this medium represents cold neutral
gas, and that it should not be used to model highly ionised transfer media.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the type of normalization for the amount of material:
      1. Normalization by defining the total mass
      2. Normalization by defining the total number of entities
      3. Normalization by defining the optical depth along a coordinate axis
      4. Normalization by defining the mass column density along a coordinate axis
      5. Normalization by defining the number column density along a coordinate axis
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,5] (3): 5
   Possible choices for the axis along which to specify the normalization:
      1. The X axis of the model coordinate sytem
      2. The Y axis of the model coordinate sytem
      3. The Z axis of the model coordinate sytem
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3): 1
 ? Enter the number column density along this axis ]0 1/cm2,∞ 1/cm2[: 2e24
\endverbatim

The total amount of obscuring gas in an torus is commonly expressed through the equatorial number column density of
neutral hydrogen \f$N_\mathrm{H}\f$. You can follow this convention by selecting "normalization through the number
column density" and "along the X-axis". However, SKIRT normalizes the medium along the entire X-axis, while the
observed value characterizes the amount of material as measured from the source outwards. Therefore, to model a torus
with \f$N_\mathrm{H} = 10^{24}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\f$, you must specify twice this value in SKIRT. Finally, we note that
the medium normalization in SKIRT is based on the smooth base geometry instead of the clumpy geometry (which would
cause a random normalization based on the random number of clumps along the X axis).

\verbatim
   Possible choices for item #2 in the transfer media list:
      1. A transfer medium with a built-in geometry
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,5] (1): 0
\endverbatim

When asked for a second medium component, enter zero to terminate the list.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusGrid Spatial grid

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the spatial grid:
      1. A 3D spatial grid in cylindrical coordinates
      2. A Cartesian spatial grid
      3. A tree-based spatial grid
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,3] (3): 3
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the X direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: -15
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the X direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: 15
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the Y direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: -15
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the Y direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: 15
 ? Enter the start point of the box in the Z direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: -15
 ? Enter the end point of the box in the Z direction ]-∞ pc,∞ pc[: 15
   Possible choices for the tree construction policy (configuration options):
      1. A tree grid construction policy using the medium density distribution
   Automatically selected the only choice: 1
 ? Enter the minimum level of grid refinement [0,99] (3): 3
 ? Enter the maximum level of grid refinement [0,99] (7): 9
 ? Enter the maximum fraction of gas contained in each cell [0,0.01] (1e-6): 1e-5
\endverbatim

SKIRT discretizes the medium on a spatial grid, i.e. a collection of small cells in which properties such as medium
density are considered to be uniform. Because the clumpy structure of the torus in this tutorial does not exbit any
spatial symmetries, the simulation must use a fully three-dimensional grid. It is best to choose an adaptive grid that
automatically forms smaller cells in denser regions, i.e. in and around the clumps. The adaptive grid will take some
time to construct, but compared to a regular Cartesian grid with the same number of grid cells, it will provide a
higher level of accuracy.

For this tutorial, select a tree-based spatial grid. The grid must fully enclose the clumpy torus with a radius of 15
pc, so specify a cube of 30 pc in each direction, centered on the origin. Because of the torus geometry, the vertical
size could be somewhat smaller. However, the adaptive grid will form fairly large cells in the empty space under and
above the torus, so that this will not significantly slow down the simulation. Furthermore, this allows you to vary the
torus opening angle without the need to update the octree grid borders in the Z-direction.

For the purposes of this tutorial simulation, acceptable grid parameter values are a minimum grid refinement level of
3, a maximum grid refinement level of 9, and a maximum fraction of gas contained in each cell of \f$10^{-5}\f$. For
high-quality simulations, you will need to raise the maximum level to 10 or more, and the maximum fraction of gas mass
per cell should be set to a smaller (and thus more stringent) value. This will result in a grid with more and smaller
cells, increasing accuracy as well as execution time. For more information on configuring spatial grids, see \ref
TutorialGridsTreeVoro.

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusInst Instrument system

\verbatim
   Possible choices for the default instrument wavelength grid:
      1. A logarithmic wavelength grid
         ...
 ? Enter one of these numbers [1,8] (1): 1
 ? Enter the shortest wavelength [1239.841876 keV,1.239841876e-9 keV]: 150 keV

 ? Enter the number of wavelength grid points [2,2000000000] (25): 500
\endverbatim

SKIRT instruments record wavelength-dependent quantities in a finite number of discrete wavelength bins. In user
experience level \em Basic, the default instrument wavelength grid is used by definition for all instruments. In higher
experience levels, a specific wavelength grid can be configured for each individual instrument if so desired.

For this tutorial, configure a logarithmic wavelength grid (the default option) with 500 bins between 150 keV and 0.3
keV, which will produce high-resolution X-ray spectra.

\verbatim
   Possible choices for item #1 in the instruments list:
      1. A distant instrument that outputs the spatially integrated flux density as an SED
      2. A distant instrument that outputs the surface brightness in every pixel as a data cube
      3. A distant instrument that outputs both the flux density (SED) and surface brightness (data cube)

   Possible choices for item #2 in the instruments list:
      1. A distant instrument that outputs the spatially integrated flux density as an SED
      2. A distant instrument that outputs the surface brightness in every pixel as a data cube
      3. A distant instrument that outputs both the flux density (SED) and surface brightness (data cube)

 ? Enter the azimuth angle φ of the detector [-360 deg,360 deg] (0 deg): 0
 ? Do you want to record flux components separately? [yes/no] (no): y
   Possible choices for item #3 in the instruments list:
      1. A distant instrument that outputs the spatially integrated flux density as an SED
      2. A distant instrument that outputs the surface brightness in every pixel as a data cube
      3. A distant instrument that outputs both the flux density (SED) and surface brightness (data cube)
 ? Enter one of these numbers or zero to terminate the list [0,3] (1): 0
\endverbatim

Configure two %SED instruments named "I00" and "I90", both at a distance of 10 Mpc, at an inclination of 0 degrees and
90 degrees, respectively. The azimuth angle can be left to zero (the default value). When asked to record the flux
components separately, answer "yes": this causes SKIRT to output the direct flux contribution (i.e. the extinct input
spectrum) and the reprocessed flux contribution, in addition to the total observed spectrum.

When asked for a third instrument, enter zero to terminate the list.

Configure the following probes and specify their names as indicated in the following table. When asked for the
wavelength at which the optical depth should be calculated, enter 40 keV.

\section TutorialXRayTorusPerform Performing the simulation

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusRun The simulation

Make sure that both the ski file \c ClumpyTorus.ski and the %SED input file \c PowerLawSED.txt are in your current
directory. To actually perform the simulation, start SKIRT again, this time specifying the name of the ski file on the
command line:

\verbatim
$ skirt ClumpyTorus
\endverbatim


\subsection TutorialXRayTorusConvergence Convergence

The output files for this tutorial are similar to those already described for a previous tutorial (see \ref
TutorialBasicsMonoOutput and \ref TutorialBasicsPanOutput).

To check the spatial grid convergence metrics, open the output of the first convergence probe \c
ClumpyTorus_cnv_convergence.dat in a text editor. You should see results similar to the following (your numbers will
differ because of the random placement of the clumps and the random density sampling involved in constructing the
spatial grid):

\verbatim
Total mass
  Input:   4.188e+06 Msun
  Gridded: 4.19e+06 Msun (0.06 %)

Optical depth at 40 keV along full X-axis
  Input:   1.44986
  Gridded: 0.727971 (-49.79 %)

Optical depth at 40 keV along full Y-axis
  Input:   1.44986
  Gridded: 1.76361 (21.64 %)

Optical depth at 40 keV along full Z-axis
  Input:   0
  Gridded: 0
\endverbatim

With the grid configuration recommended for this tutorial, the total mass convergence is almost perfect. However, when
comparing the gridded optical depths through the medium with the input values, you might find differences up to 50 per
cent. This is because the input values refer to the smooth base geometry, while the gridded values include the effect
of random clumping. For more information, see the \ref TutorialXRayTorusSmoothTorus at the end of this tutorial.

Because the geometry in this simulation is three-dimensional (i.e. it has no symmetries), the second convergence probe
produces three cuts through the cold gas density. You can open the theoretical density cuts \c
ClumpyTorus_dns_gas_t_XX.fits and the gridded density cuts \c ClumpyTorus_dns_gas_g_XX.fits with a FITS file viewer, or
you can visualize them using PTS:

\verbatim
$ pts plot_convergence .
   Starting visual/plot_convergence...
   Created /.../ClumpyTorus_dns_gas.pdf
   Finished visual/plot_convergence.
$
\endverbatim

\image html TutorialXRayTorusConvergence.png

The cuts in this figure show that the spatial grid encompasses the entire torus medium, and that the density
distribution is nicely discretized. The purple cells at the torus edges are a consequence of applying adaptive gridding
using cuboidal cells lined up with the Cartesian coordinate axes. These cells do not have a significant effect on the
radiative transfer results because their medium density is orders of magnitude lower than the relevant torus densities.
The figure also shows how the denser clumps are nicely resolved with smaller grid cells.

You can also visualise this effect in the grid using PTS, using the information produced by the third probe configured
for your simulation:

\verbatim
$ pts plot_grids .
   Starting visual/plot_grids...
   Created grid plot /.../ClumpyTorus_grd_grid_xy.pdf
   Created /.../ClumpyTorus_grd_grid_xyz.pdf
   Created grid plot /.../ClumpyTorus_grd_grid_xz.pdf
   Created grid plot /.../ClumpyTorus_grd_grid_yz.pdf
   Finished visual/plot_grids.
(base) pcamps@kenobi:~/SKIRT/SKIRT9/run/xraytorus$
\endverbatim

This yields the following cuts along horizontal and vertical planes through the adaptive grid, showing that the grid

\subsection TutorialXRayTorusSpectra Spectra

The two instruments configured for this tutorial simulation each produce an %SED. The column text files \c
ClumpyTorus_I00_sed.dat and \c ClumpyTorus_I90_sed.dat represent the spectral energy distribution of the photon packets
detected by each instrument. The total observed flux can be easily plotted using the following PTS command:

\verbatim
$ pts plot_seds . --unit=keV --wmin=150 --wmax=0.3 --dex=8
   Starting visual/plot_seds...
   Created /.../ClumpyTorus_sed.pdf
   Finished visual/plot_seds.
$
\endverbatim

By default, the SEDs for all instruments in the simulation are combined on the same figure. The first instrument
I00 provides an unobscured, face-on view of the X-ray corona, and the  observed spectrum closely resembles the input
power law, with an additional Fe Ka line at 6.4 keV and an Fe Kb line at 7.1 keV produced by reprocessing in the
torus. The second instrument I90 probes a heavily obscured sightline (edge-on view of the torus), for which the
primary emission is mostly absorbed at soft X-ray energies. As the primary source is obscured, the X-ray reflection
spectrum stands out more prominently, showing many fluorescent lines, and a clear Fe K absorption edge at 7.1 keV.

Now inspect the file \c ClumpyTorus_I90_sed.dat in a text editor. In addition to the wavelength column (in keV), there
are several corresponding flux columns (in 1/s/cm2/keV):

- total flux: the total observed flux detected by the instrument, including the effects of extinction and reprocessing.

- transparent flux: the flux that would have been detected by the instrument if there were no medium in the model; in
this case this is identical to the input power-law spectrum.

- direct primary flux: the flux originating from primary sources that directly reaches the instrument, i.e. the extinct
power-law emission.

- scattered primary flux: the flux originating from the primary sources that was scattered by the medium at least once
before reaching the instrument.

- direct secondary flux: the flux originating from fluorescence interactions with the medium that directly reaches the
instrument.

- scattered secondary flux: the flux originating from fluorescence interactions with the medium that was scattered by
the medium at least once before reaching the instrument.

- transparent secondary flux: the flux originating from fluorescence interactions without taking into account any
further interactions with the medium.

All flux components other than the "transparent" fluxes properly include extinction effects. Consequently, the total
flux equals the sum of the four components (direct primary flux, scattered primary flux, direct secondary flux,
scattered secondary flux).

\note Because of the way X-ray reprocessing is implemented in SKIRT, the fluorescent flux is recorded as secondary flux
(direct or scattered) even if the simulation does not explictly include a secondary emission phase. This allows users
to distinguish the effects of the various phsyical processes (most notably, Compton scattering and fluorescence).

These individual flux contributions can easily be plotted by running the following Python script:

\code{.py}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
E, T, I, D, S1, S2, S3, _ = np.loadtxt("ClumpyTorus_I90_sed.dat", unpack=True)
plt.loglog(E, I, label="input")
plt.loglog(E, S1+S2+S3, label="reprocessed")
plt.loglog(E, D, label="direct")
plt.loglog(E, T, label="total")
plt.xlim(1, 150)
plt.ylim(1e-7, 0.2)
plt.xlabel("$E~[keV]$")
plt.ylabel("$F_E~[\mathrm{keV}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}]$")
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("ClumpyTorusContributions.pdf")
\endcode

This figure shows the significant contribution of the reflection spectrum to the total observed continuum beyond 10
keV, forming the so-called Compton hump. The reflection spectrum still is a bit noisy, which can be improved by
increasing the number of photon packets (which will also increase the simulation run time).


\section TutorialXRayTorusSmoothTorus Optional section: a smooth torus

This optional tutorial section shows the effect of the clumps in the torus model by comparing the clumpy density
distribution to a smooth distribution with the same total mass. This is very easy to accomplish as follows:

- Make a copy of the ski file \c ClumpyTorus.ski and rename it to \c SmoothTorus.ski
- Open \c SmoothTorus.ski in a text editor and scroll to the line representing the \em ClumpyGeometryDecorator
- Update the value of the \em clumpFraction property to zero:

      <ClumpyGeometryDecorator clumpFraction="0" numClumps="1000" ... >

- Save the changes

\note You could also remove the \em ClumpyGeometryDecorator altogether, but this is somewhat tricky as you need to
preserve the proper nesting in the XML-formatted ski file.

Now perform the \c SmoothTorus simulation with SKIRT and evaluate the output files in the same way as you did
previosuly for the \c ClumpyTorus simulation. Specifically, the optical depth convergence statistics produced by the
first probe now show differences smaller than 1 per cent, because both the input and gridded metrics now apply to a
smooth distribution. Also, the density cuts along the coordinate planes reflect a smooth (and constant) density
across the torus geometry.

You can plot the observed spectra in the same way as before. However, for an easier comparison it is desirable to plot
the spectra from both simulations in a single figure. This can be accomplished by running a variation of the previously
shown python script:

\code{.py}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
E, T, I, *rest = np.loadtxt("ClumpyTorus_I90_sed.dat", unpack=True)
plt.loglog(E, I, label="input")
plt.loglog(E, T, label="clumpy torus")
E, T, I, *rest = np.loadtxt("SmoothTorus_I90_sed.dat", unpack=True)
plt.loglog(E, T, label="smooth torus")
plt.xlim(1, 150)
plt.ylim(1e-7, 0.2)
plt.xlabel("$E~[keV]$")
plt.ylabel("$F_E~[\mathrm{keV}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}]$")
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("SmoothTorusComparison.pdf")
\endcode

At an inclination of 90 degrees (edge-on), the observed X-ray spectra for the smooth torus geometry are significantly
more absorbed. This is because the clumpy model sightline passes mostly through the inter-clump medium, which is only
half as dense as the smooth torus medium (see the density cuts in \ref TutorialXRayTorusConvergence).


\section TutorialXRayTorusLowIntensityLines Advanced section: low-intensity lines

The output spectra simulated for the clumpy torus model in this tutorial clearly show a number of fluorescence lines in
the energy range below 3 keV (see the figures in \ref TutorialXRayTorusSpectra). However, because of high absorption
rates, the observed flux levels in that energy range are several orders of magnitude below the input spectrum and below
the levels at energies above 10 keV. As a result, the numerical noise produced by the simulation may in fact dominate
the true output signal, especially when studying relatively low-intensity fluorescence lines in this energy range.

To increase the signal to noise ratio, we need to adjust two relevant simulation parameters: an advanced parameter
called "minum weight reduction", which regulates an aspect of the Monte Carlo photon packet cycle in SKIRT, and the
number of photon packets launched in the simulation.

A transfer medium in SKIRT usually implements both absorption and scattering interactions with photon packets. For the
XRayAtomicGasMix medium considered here, florescence is implemented as scattering: the photon packet, with reduced
luminosity and new wavelength, is relaunched from the interaction location in a random direction. Thus, as SKIRT traces
a photon packet through the medium, the packet looses luminosity at each interaction until it becomes sufficiently
insignificant to be terminated. By default, a photon packet is terminated when its luminosity is four orders of
magnitude lower than its original luminosity (the advanced parameter is set to \em minWeightReduction ="1e4"). With
this value, low-intensity fluorescence photon packets may be terminated before having a chance to register in the
instruments. To ensure that low-intensity lines are properly included in the output spectrum, the minimum weight
reduction factor must be increased to, say, ten orders of magnitude (\em minWeightReduction ="1e10"). The simulation
time increases (significantly but not dramatically) because many photon packets have a longer life cycle.

The other important parameter is the number of photon packets launched in the simulation (\em numPackets). This is the
key parameter to reduce the level of noise inherent to the Monte Carlo method used by SKIRT. Unfortunately, the
simulation time scales esentially linearly with the number of photon packets. The best way to find an optimal value for
this parameter is to perform a convergence study: increase the number of photon packets until the relevant simulation
results no longer vary significantly.

To study these issues with the clumpy torus model, proceed as follows:

- Make a copy of the ski file \c ClumpyTorus.ski and rename it to \c LineTorus5e6.ski
- Open \c LineTorus5e6.ski in a text editor; leave the \em numPackets value untouched
- In the \em PhotonPacketOptions, update \em minWeightReduction to 1e10
- To increase the spectral resolution in the  energy range relevant for our study,
  update the default wavelength grid in the instrument system to a range from 3.5 to 0.9 keV and 200 wavelengths:

      <LogWavelengthGrid minWavelength="3.5 keV" maxWavelength="0.9 keV" numWavelengths="200"/>

- Save the changes
- Make two more copies of the file you just saved and rename them to \c LineTorus5e7.ski and \c LineTorus1e8.ski
- Edit the \em numPackets in each of these files to reflect the number in listed in the filenames
- Perform all three simulations with SKIRT; on a powerful desktop with 8+8 cores, the longest simulation takes about
  30 minutes

You can easily plot the resulting spectra (at inclination of 90 degrees) with an adjusted version of the python scripts
shown earlier. This should yield a figure similar to this one:

\image html TutorialXRayTorusLines.png

With \f$5\times 10^6\f$ photon packets (the blue curve), the output spectrum is completely dominated by noise.
Increasing the number of packets tenfold to \f$5\times 10^7\f$ (the orange curve) seems to mostly resolve this problem,
however we cannot be sure without performing a further test. Doubling the number of packets to \f$10^8\f$ (the dotted
green curve), we find that the spectrum is indeed converged in the energy range above 2 keV. For lower energies, the
continuum spectrum still changes significantly with the number of photon packets. We would need to further increase the
number of packets to find convergence in this energy range as well.
