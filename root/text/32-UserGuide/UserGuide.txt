The MonteCarloSimulation class is the main driver of the photon cycle.
We also have many Geometry subclasses.
The Geometry::generatePosition() returns a random position.

In PTS, pts.simulation.simulation.createSimulation returns a pts.simulation.simulation.Simulation object.

Here we can also link to the ski file tables:

\section UserMakeUp Using MakeUp

This section should provide information on how to use MakeUp to configure ski files.

\section UserCmdLine Using SKIRT on the command line

This section should provide information on how to use SKIRT from the command line.

\section UserParamFileStruct The structure of a SKIRT configuration file

This section should provide more information on ski files.

\section UserParallel Using SKIRT with parallel threads and/or processes

This section should explain how to use SKIRT with parallel threads and/or processes, including the
mode for running multiple simulations in parallel.

\section UserPolarize Simulating polarized radiation

This section should explain how to configure SKIRT for polarization.
(primary emission, scattering by spherical grains, emission by aligned spheroidal grains)

To actually enable polarization support in a SKIRT simulation:
  - Ensure that all configured material mixes support polarization and have polarization enabled;
    see e.g. the MeanTrustBenchmarkDustMix, PolarizedGraphiteGrainComposition, PolarizedSilicateGrainComposition,
    ElectronMix, and LyaNeutralHydrogenGasMix classes.
  - Configure instruments to record polarization characteristics, i.e. Stokes vector elements;
    see the Instrument class.

\section UserLymanAlpha Simulating Lyman-alpha resonant line transfer

This section should explain how to configure SKIRT for Lyman-alpha resonant line transfer.

\section UserRedshift Placing models at a nonzero redshift

This section should explain how to work with nonzero redshift.
