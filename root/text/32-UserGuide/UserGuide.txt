The MonteCarloSimulation class is the main driver of the photon cycle.
We also have many Geometry subclasses.
The Geometry::generatePosition() returns a random position.

In PTS, pts.simulation.simulation.createSimulation returns a pts.simulation.simulation.Simulation object.

Here we link also link to the ski file tables:

\section UserMakeUp MakeUp

This section is referenced from the installation guide. It will be provided somewhere in the developer guide and should
provide information on how to use MakeUp to configure ski files.
