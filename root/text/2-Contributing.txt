\section Contributors Contributor's hall of fame

\subsection ContribCore Core team

The members of the core SKIRT team are:

- <a href = "https://users.ugent.be/~mbaes">Prof. dr. Maarten Baes</a>. Maarten conceived of SKIRT and wrote the first
several versions of the code. He continues to determine the strategic direction and to supervise further development.
Once in a while, less frequently than he would like, he contributes some nice new feature himself.

- <a href = "https://users.ugent.be/~pcamps">Dr. ir. Peter Camps</a>. Peter overhauled the SKIRT code, readying the
class design for further expansion, and initiated the Python toolkit for SKIRT. He is currently chief software
architect and main developer for the SKIRT project, acting as a gatekeeper for new code contributions.
