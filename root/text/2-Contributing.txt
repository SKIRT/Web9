\section ContributingIntroduction Introduction

Thank you for reading this page and for considering a contribution to the open source SKIRT project.
There are various valuable ways of contributing, such as:

- Using the SKIRT code in your work and providing feedback about it.
- Applying the code to various (possibly new) science cases and validating the results.
- Reporting and helping to solve installation problems, usage questions, or bugs in the code.
- Suggesting and discussing (preferably concrete and feasible) new features.
- Correcting, improving, or adding to the documentation in the code or on the web site.
- Fixing bugs or implementing new features (from just a few lines of code to whole modules).

\subsection ContributingContributorsCore Core team

The current members of the core SKIRT team are:

- <a href = "https://users.ugent.be/~mbaes">Prof. dr. Maarten Baes</a>. Maarten conceived of SKIRT and wrote the first
several versions of the code. He continues to determine the strategic direction and to supervise further development.
Once in a while, less frequently than he would like, he contributes some nice new feature himself.

- <a href = "https://users.ugent.be/~pcamps">Dr. ir. Peter Camps</a>. Peter overhauled the SKIRT code, readying the
class design for further expansion, and initiated the Python toolkit for SKIRT. He is currently chief software
architect and main developer for the SKIRT project, acting as a gatekeeper for new contributions.


\section ContributingRepositories GitHub repositories

The SKIRT project repositories are hosted as part of the [GitHub SKIRT organization](https://github.com/SKIRT). Next to
the SKIRT and PTS source code, the source text for the web site is also placed in a repository, allowing contributions
to the documentation through a workflow similar to that for source code. The following table lists the repositories in
the SKIRT organization to which new contributions should be directed.

| Repository | Description
|------------|------------
| [SKIRT9](https://github.com/SKIRT/SKIRT9) | SKIRT 9 C++ source code
| [PTS9](https://github.com/SKIRT/PTS9) | Python Toolkit for SKIRT 9
| [Web9](https://github.com/SKIRT/Web9) | SKIRT and PTS guides plus project-wide pages

Reference documentation is embedded in the source code as special comment blocks in Doxygen format, and is thus
automatically contained in a GitHub repository as a part of the development cycle. All other documentation
(installation & user guide, tutorials, etc.) is authored as a set of text files in Doxygen format (i.e. special comment
blocks without actual source code). These Doxygen source files, together with any referenced images and the relevant
Doxygen configuration files, are contained in a separate public repository as indicated in the table above.


\section ContributingWebsite Web site

All documentation related to versions 8 and 9 of the SKIRT project is published on the web site
[www.skirt.ugent.be](http://www.skirt.ugent.be/), which is hosted on the Ghent University web server. Each repository
in the GitHub SKIRT organization includes a \c makeHTML.sh procedure that drives Doxygen to locally build HTML pages
from the comment blocks embedded in the source code or text files in the repository. This procedure converts LaTeX
formulas to images, performing a full LaTeX syntax check along the way. As a result, this procedure enables
contributors to verify changes in the documentation before initiating a pull request (assuming Doxygen is installed on
their system).

To allow combining the documentation from the various repositories into a single web site, the Web9 repository also
contains a \c stageWebsite.sh procedure to locally build the complete web site from a local copy of all relevant
repositories (SKIRT8, SKIRT9, PTS, PTS9, Web8, Web9). This procedure uses MATHJAX to render LaTeX formulas, which
avoids the many images created by an explicit conversion, and leads to a much more pleasing formula presentation. While
any contributor can stage the web site, assuming they have a local copy of all relevant repositories, only a core team
member can actually publish the web site because it requires write access rights to the web server.


\section ContributingData Data

Because of size limitations on the Ghent University web server and in GitHub repositories, data files needed by the
code and/or linked from the web site are handled separately and are hosted on the Ghent University science faculty data
server. Examples of extra data files include:

 - External resources for SKIRT.
 - Example data used in tutorials on SKIRT or PTS.
 - Configuration, input and reference data for SKIRT benchmark tests.

These data files are prepared and published by a core team member. There is at this point no automated workflow for
other contributors to participate in this effort, although many of the procedures are available as part of PTS. For
example, contributors can locally prepare and use new SKIRT 9 stored table resource files by adjusting or extending the
appropriate PTS functions.


\section ContributingTeams GitHub teams

The [GitHub SKIRT organization](https://github.com/SKIRT) currently offers three access levels:

<TABLE>
<TR><TD>
Any GitHub user
</TD><TD>
Because the repositories are public, any GitHub user has read access and can post an issue or send a pull request
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
[<b>Contributor</b> team](https://github.com/orgs/SKIRT/teams/contributor) members
</TD><TD>
Members of this team have access to the SKIRT Contributor team page so that they can participate in project-wide
discussions and receive SKIRT-related broadcast notifications
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
[<b>Core</b> team](https://github.com/orgs/SKIRT/teams/core) members
</TD><TD>
The core SKIRT team members have push access rights to the repositories and are responsible for managing issues and
pull requests (e.g., closing issues or merging pull requests)
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

Users with a specific interest in SKIRT are encouraged to become a member of the Contributor team. Notifications about
important events (e.g., a new major feature becoming available, or an upcoming SKIRT user group meeting) will be
broadcast to contributors through the GitHub Contributor team page. The team page also facilitates discussions that are
not directly related to a particular technical issue. For example, there could be discussions about a given SKIRT use
case or about an upcoming conference in a related field.

To become a member of the SKIRT Contributor team, contact one of the core SKIRT team members:
  - Use the email address listed at the top of the [GitHub SKIRT organization](https://github.com/SKIRT) page.
  - Refer to \ref LegalCon for information on how to contact the core team members.

For more information on GitHub team discussions, refer to
[GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-team-discussions).


\section ContributingIssues GitHub issues

Usage questions, bug reports and feature requests are managed through the \em issues system offered by GitHub for each
of the repositories listed in section \ref ContributingRepositories above. Anyone can post an issue, and anyone can
respond. Users are encouraged to participate also by adding relevant information to issues posted by other users.
Example contributions in this area include:

 - Suggesting solutions or workarounds for a problem posted by another user.
 - Providing extra information to a bug report (e.g., does it also happen on another operating system?).
 - Supporting feature requests, or suggesting alternative solutions.

The Core team is responsible for following up on and eventually closing issues as needed.

To post an issue:
 - Browse to the SKIRT repository for which this issue is relevant (see section \ref ContributingRepositories above).
 - Select the "Issues" tab.
 - Click the green "New Issue" button.
 - Select one of "Bug report", "Feature request", or "Usage question".
 - Add a title and complete all relevant sections in the provided template.
 - Click the green "Submit" button.

For more information on GitHub issues, refer to [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues).


\section ContributingPullRequests GitHub pull requests

The repositories in the SKIRT organization use the GitHub \em fork \em and \em pull workflow model. Anyone can fork a
repository, push changes to their personal fork, and initiate a pull request. The changes can be pulled into the
original repository by a Core team member, possibly after discussion and/or being adjusted in one or more iterations.

To get started with contributing to one of the SKIRT project repositories:
 - On the GitHub web site, fork the relevant repository (for a list, see section \ref ContributingRepositories above).
 - Clone this personal fork to your computer (possibly replacing your direct clone of the original repository).

To initiate a pull request:
 - On the GitHub web site, synchronize your personal fork with the upstream repository.
 - On your local (cloned) copy, pull the latest version, and create a new topic branch for your changes.
 - Make the desired changes, commit them, and push them to your personal fork.
 - Test your changes, and repeat the previous line as many times as needed.
 - On the GitHub web site, go to the upstream repository.
 - Create a pull request for the topic branch of your fork to be merged into the master branch of the upstream repository.
 - Wait for feedback from the Core SKIRT team.

This worklow is discussed in more detail in \ref GitHubWorkFlow.
