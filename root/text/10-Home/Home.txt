\section HomeWelcome Welcome!

The SKIRT project offers state-of-the-art software for simulating radiation transfer in astrophysical systems such as
galaxies, accretion disks, or star forming regions. At the project's heart is the C++ SKIRT code, which employs the
Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the
transfer medium. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries, radiation sources, transfer medium
characterizations, spatial grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for importing models generated by
hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined in a parameter file that can be
constructed through a user-friendly command-line Q&A session, or with an optional graphical interface. Another optional
component of the SKIRT project is the "Python Toolkit for SKIRT", or PTS. The Python code in this toolkit can help
prepare, postprocess, and visualize SKIRT-related data, or it can execute SKIRT simulations in automated contexts.

The SKIRT project is fully open source, including all C++ and Python code and the contents of this web site (see \ref
ContributingRepositories), and it is publicly available for use under liberal licensing conditions (see \ref
LegalInfo). The SKIRT code runs all relevant benchmarks (see \ref Benchmarks) and is extensively documented on various
levels of expertise (see \ref Documentation). Results of applying SKIRT to various astrophysical models have been
reported in many refereed publications (see \ref PublicationsGallery "Publications"). We invite you to use the SKIRT
project's software for your work, and to interact with other users and/or contribute to the project (see \ref
Contributing). Let us know what you think (see \ref Contact).

\subsection HomeFeaturesSKIRT Key features of the SKIRT code

Model:
- Configure any one-, two- or three-dimensional geometry without limitation.
- Employ the extensive built-in library to describe the spatial distribution of primary sources and transfer media.
- Import components from hydrodynamic simulation snapshots using SPH, AMR, or Voronoi paradigms.
- Combine multiple sources and multiple media components, each with their own spatial distributions and properties.
- Combine different media types, including dust, electrons and gas (see below for supported physics).
- Rely on built-in turn-key dust mixtures or configure your own, including optical properties and size distributions.
- Include instruments for recording "observed" spectra, broadband images, and spectroscopic data cubes.
- Include probes for recording data internal to the model, such as cuts through the radiation field.

Physics:
- Sources emitting continuum and/or line spectra, possibly anisotropic and/or polarized.
- Wavelengths including X-ray, UV to submm, and radio.
- Multiple anisotropic scattering, absorption and (re-)emission by the transfer medium.
- Doppler shifts caused by moving sources and/or media (kinematics) and/or by placing the model at a given redshift.
- Polarization caused by scattering on spherical dust grains or by emission from aligned spheroidal dust grains.
- Stochastic heating of and emission by small dust grains in non-equilibrium conditions.
- Compton and Thomson scattering by electrons.
- Photo-absorption, fluorescence and bound-electron scattering by cold gas media.
- Absorption and emission at rotational transitions for selected species, including OH, HCO+, CO, C and C+.
- Absorption and emission at 21 cm spin-flip transition in neutral atomic hydrogen
- Resonant scattering by neutral hydrogen near the Lyman-alpha line.
- Self-consistent calculation of medium state, secondary emission, and radiation field through iteration
  (e.g., dust destruction, dust self-absorption, electronic level populations of selected gas species).

Numerics:
- Monte Carlo method for tracing photon packets through the spatial domain.
- All relevant accerelation techniques: peel-off, forced scattering, continuous absorption, explicit absorption, ...
- Photon packet wavelengths sampled from the source spectrum without intermediate interpolation.
- Separate, configurable wavelength grids for storing the radiation field, for discretizing emission spectra, and for
  recording output spectra or data cubes.
- Wide range of modern spatial grids, both regular and adaptive, including grids optimized for 1D or 2D models.
- Optional output of statistics that help estimate error bars on results.

User interface:
- Interactive console Q&A session to guide user through configuration process.
- %Configuration defined in XML-based parameter files, allowing straightforward manual editing.
- Optional graphical user interface to create and edit configuration files.
- Support for commonly used units for reading input and writing output quantities

Performance:
- Efficient in both memory consumption and processor time.
- Fully parallelized using multiple threads (shared memory) and/or multiple processes (distributed memory).
- Scales well from laptop to multi-node cluster.

Code design:
- Written in standard C++14 with very few other dependencies.
- Modern object-oriented design with well-defined programming interfaces between components.
- Extensively documented source code.


\subsection HomeFeaturesPTS Key features of the Python Toolkit for SKIRT (PTS)

Working with SKIRT:
- Interact with SKIRT configuration files.
- Allow automated SKIRT execution (on the local host computer).
- Load SKIRT output files with support for units.
- Convolve SEDs or IFUs with the same broadband filters as those supported by SKIRT.
- Visualize SKIRT output, including image frames, SEDs, density cuts, temperature cuts, polarization maps, and more.

Supporting the SKIRT development process:
- Run functional test cases and prepare test reports.
- Convert various tabulated third-party data formats to SKIRT's unified built-in stored table format.
- Prepare SKIRT built-in resource packs for publication.
- Back up (portions of) the development data/source code directory.

User interface:
- Acessible from the command line, from notebooks (such as Jupyter), and through regular Python function calls.

Code design:
- Developed for Python 3.7 or later using widely available packages only.
- Modern coding practices and nicely documented.
